Do you mind if I record you? 

Yeah that’s fine.

Awesome. Thank you. So I'm just gonna be taking me through the MVP, the most viable product, minimum viable product, sorry, for one of my courses. We're making a website about course planning. All right. So we've called it UQ plan-it. Up here, we've got, you know, names for the degree. You can just type in, edit it in the actual website as you need, but this is just the figma. So we want to load the plan, right? That's just the one we've got now. So if we select our degree, we've done it for compsci students, because that's, you know, what the degree is a part of. And we can place these courses into a nice setup here. So we've just selected a major, cyber security as an example. And comp 1100, so let's take that in 2025 semester one, right? And that's our first course. We just took it from the core course list here, right? You've also got breadth courses, which have a few more there. Unfortunately, right now, we can't put those in because of the limitations of Figma, and there's also the major options. In the actual website, those are all functional, but the website itself right now is having some technical difficulties. So I hope you understand. 

That makes sense. 

Anyway, we go back to core and that was inf1200 that we put in. Comp now, 1081 and CSSE. So you obviously will be able to put all courses in when we actually have it working. I'm so annoyed that it isn't, because you saw it earlier. 

Yeah fair enough. 

Yeah, so all the core courses will obviously be listed here, the general electives will also be listed here I see isn’t in this mock. 

Yeah. 

And all the majors, the just drag and drop. If it's incompatible, it won't let you do it, okay? If it's in the wrong semester, so say, of course, I'm going to be taken in semester one and you try to take it in semester two. It won't let you put it there because it's obviously, you know, impossible. If you haven't completed prerequisites, that's not enforced by my-SI-net. So we do let you do it, but we give you a warning as well. Yeah, okay. All right, so that's like the general playout of the prototype right now. So I've just got some questions for you if that's okay. 

Go for it.

All right, so for the current system, of course, planning, what about it is so sluggish? 

It's pretty.. It's a bit. How do I put it? It's a bit unintuitive. Um.. doesn't, like, I don't even know, yet, to have a There was a course plan and a look at until I'd already commenced uni and completely didn't use it at all. And generally, like picking courses, like, and kind of getting a fuller idea of the actual, like, what you're doing through the entire time is very lack lter. Like, you're on with actually plan more than maybe a year or maybe two years if you're really lucky without having to do so much extra stuff yourself, which is kind of a bit, um, I'm very use of friendly. Like, I feel like you need. a lot of changes to make that something viable that makes sense. Yeah. Like that's my biggest gripe. It's just not easy, or simple. 

So with that in mind then, would you say that this solution where you just dynamically choose something in place it, is far more effective than the current solution? 

Yeah, 100%. No, no doubt, yeah. 

Right, and do you also prefer the fact that it's got one tab? 

Yeah, I just I like it. It's just all there. Like, again, biggest issue is, you got to find a course planner. Yeah. Then you got to go put your courses in. You gotta have your own planner to figure out what you're doing past the first semester, two semesters a year. Like, if you could trying to play in year two, year three, year four, on top, you don't you don't get to. Whereas this makes it easier and yeah, I think that's. I think that's a great tool. 

Right. Awesome. So that skips a few questions.. Do you think there's any benefits to having a lot of tabs open for each course? And before you answer that, just a quick clarification, we don't include course information here. So it just tells you what the prerequisites are, what's incompatible, and what it is. Right? On the working website, there's a little column on the right-hand side here that isn't spaced out, but there is space there on the website, where it'll tell you some vague information, but link it to the actual course. 

Oh, that's great.. 

So that way, if you want to know more about it, you just go straight to it and that way, you, once again, you don't have to go through a thick weed of tabs to actually find it. It's just there. Do you think that's good? 

Yeah, it's really, really intuitive. Again, it takes the whole issue of going through the big list of courses being like, oh, is this fun, the one I'm digging over, is it this? Or like, and then having them all the through, whereas, you know, abbreviated just to make sure you put in the right person, but also, like, the link, the proper link to the actual subject itself, on my, really weirdly hard to find. It's not made to just be something quick to do. It's like, oh, it's a whole activity. You gotta go through it. Okay. So, yeah, 100%. That's great. 

And then if this was readily available, would you use it? 

Oh, yeah. Easily. I barely know what I'm doing in year two, year three, year four, so, I mean, it'd be good.. Only thing I could point out was it does do bachelor, it does do major, but UQ has been introducing, like, doubles and verticles. Is that something you're thinking I'm putting in now or would that be something future? 

Okay, yeah, so in our group, three of us are doing a dual degree of compsci mathematics, so we are starting to… 

…a big coincidence. 

…Yeah. We are starting to collate the mathematics starter and added an option for a dual degree. We actually have done the master and data science. 

Oh. 

But it's once again, the website, just it broke in one of the most recent iterations of it, so  we’re working on fixing it. So yeah, it is something that we've considered. But for the MVP right now, we've tried to keep it as simple as possible to give a proof of concept. 

That's perfect, but you have considered it. 

Yeah, absolutely absolutely. 

Obviously, I do, I do a vertical, like, it's kind of an important thing for me because they cut out a lot of courses here and there and it's like, kind of, I don't want to commit to a course if I then turn around and realise, that was with people who have, like, who aren't doing the votocol, that's the full thing, not just the quick one. So, obviously, that's great that you're considering it. 

Okay. What about what else? Do you find this better than what you do now? Is there anything in particular that you think could be better? So obviously you said more planning, but anything else?

Not particularly, um. Again, again. Like, I get the, like, that question I was forward my only gripe was that I couldn't see the verticals that, honestly, no, it's a great system. How do you, um how are you getting this data? Is this an API, are you doing a handmade for each individual course? 

So, I got all of the data into a spreadsheet and then all of that data was then inserted by another group member into a database, and then we linked that database. 

Right, then it's painstaking. 

It did take a while. We did request for the courses, but they didn't give them to us, so we had to do it manually, which is why we were also sticking to compsci maths because that's you know, what we're doing' again. 

For the MVP that makes sense. 

Yeah. Yeah, no, but I just want to. So, in that case, would that be.. Because, like, UQ has been adding new degrees every year. So, um, would that be something you could consider, like, like, would that be something you're considering, like an API? Or would, is it just going to be that handmade do it do it yourself every time it's added? 

Look, in an ideal world, we would want it all to be automated. They just give us all the data and then we do it instantly, right?. As it currently stands, we're looking at doing it all by hand, which definitely sucks. But honestly, it didn't take that long.

So a hypothetically next year, compsci adds five more courses. That's just. 

Which they are. 

Yeah. If this were a real product, would that just be as simple as, like, would that be something you'd just go, look, you know, new users, five more subjects maybe, like, one, two, three, four, five done. 

Yeah, exactly. Add it to the database and then all we have to do is create the card. It's super easy. 

Yeah, then that looks really scalable scalable. Like, um yeah, I've got no other questions about it. That's It seems like a really good product and, I honestly, a lot of work seems to have gone. This is like, this is actually like good thinking. I don't know. I, 

Thank you for your time. 

No, no, no worries 

It was very helpful.
