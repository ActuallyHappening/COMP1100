Speaker 1: Is it okay if I record you? 

speaker 2: Yep. 

speaker 1: Thank you. 

So if you'll quickly take a look at my computer screen here, I'm going to be showing you through our MVP, which is our minimal viable product for our comp 1100 project, which is essentially targeted at making course planning at UQ easier for students. Right? So this is the first screen when you load, so right now, the only commencement year that we actually have is 2025, but that hardly matters because it just takes you to a screen for the next four years anyway, the year doesn't matter that this semester is the thing that matters.

And you select a course. So right now, we've only got computer science and computer science and laws. It's a strange combo.

Don't ask why. We can name the plan up at the top, so let's just call it FL's plan, right? And that'll save up in the top right, then I can create a new plan, plan two, let's call it Liam's planan, and I can switch between Raphael's plan Liam's plan, and that will also save, and we'll see that in a second. 

So we're going to choose Bachelor of compai for Raphael's plan, and I'm going to choose a major in, say, data science, and you can see on the right hand side here we have all the course requirements. So there are currently zero out of 16 core courses that have been completed, and there's a max oh, that' sorry, that's units, eight courses, and there's a max of 16 units that you can complete for core courses. The major also requires 16 units, and then there are compulsory courses here, which is an additional 16 units. 

And that you encompasses breadth, electives, and general electives. And so the total amount of coursuses 48 units, so 24 courses. On the left hand side here, we can see all the available core courses that we have to do, right? 

We go to the major courses. Now, this updates based on our major. So if I change my major from data science to scientific computing, you can see that the course has changed that. 

But we're going to go back to data science for the time being. And the breadth electives is every single breath elective in the compi course, and for laws, we've got all those electives as well, and then general electives right now is just every single cause from the compite course list because there's a lot of generalnal electives, and that takes a very long time to put in. So just for the MVP right now, we've got a lot of compsite courses to choose from. 

So if I say compP 1100, which is this course, let's put it in semester two actually, let's put it in semester one, right? So as you can see, when I clicked on it, these highlighted red, because technically, it's prerequisites haven't been completed. But since that isn't enforced by my assign it, we also don't enforce it. 

So we let you place it there, right? And if I want to place a course like comp 2048, as you can see, it can only be completed and semester 1, so if I click on that, it won't let me place it in semester two, right? I can't do it, I can only place it in semester one, okay? 

And as you can see here, the prerequisites haven't been passed, so it's given me a little warning. Once again, that's not enforced by my assign it, but it won't won't, you know, be all, green flax, right? So let's put CSSC 1001 here and let's move Compple 1100 to here. 

And now, since you saw that it was green for a moment there because the prerequisites are now passed and you're allowed to do that course. So that that's the general premise. So as you can see, we just put those two courses in those positions for no apparent reason. 

And if I quickly switched to Liam's plan and I select computer science laws and let's find his law. I haven't actually gone through.. You don't get a major in law. 

Yeah, I'll hear with the law courses. So the core courses for law, there are two core sections, one for cite, one for law, right? So if I put in law 1700 there and I put in law 1702, a place that can't be completed because I haven't done its prerequisites, right as it highlights there. 

And I switch back to my plan. It's saved. If I refresh the page, which takes a few seconds, it's still saves. 

Right? And I can go back to, Ooopsie, can go back to Liam's plane. And on the right hand side here, we've got all the links for the courses as well, so this will take you straight to the course profile, right? 

And that way, it's a lot easier to just, like the courses are all there. You just go to the right hand side, you more information and bang, it's all there. So with this in mind, I' just going to ask you a few questions about our MVP if that's okay? 

Speaker 2: Yep. 

Speaker 1: Okay, thank you.. So, what about the current system, of course, planning to you find very sluggish? 

Speaker 2: Um That's slow. It takes forever to load. That is the definition of sluggish. 

Would you say that it's like too many tabs open? Like, do you not like the fact that you kind of swarmed with a lot of definitions for your courses and like it just, like reading a ton of things about them trying to figure out what goes? 

speaker 2: Yeah, I think there's a lot of a lot of jargon about like, you need to complete this many units from this and you need to complete so many units from that and it can get confusing when it also says that like you can do this or you can do that or you can do a major or you can't do a major and then it gets very confusing. 

speaker 1: Okay. um Is there any benefits to having multiple tabs open, do you think? 

speaker 2: No. 

speaker 1: Right, so you definitely prefer the one tab system? 

speaker 2: Yeah. 

speaker 1: Okay, thank you.. T road a load into my timetable. 

Yeah. And then roll on a course. Would you say that it makes it easier to find required information for courses and our system as opposed to going through courses right now? 

speaker 2: Can you ask me that again? 

speaker 1: Sorry, it's okay. Would you say that it makes it easier in our solution to find coarse information than currently? 

Like I showed you once you click on? It's course information? Like the course profile. 

Or, you know, like I just go there and then bang of onceert loads. It's right here. That stuff. 

speaker 2: Yeah, sure. I think it's pretty simple, a similar though. Right, okay, but it's all centralised here. 

speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. So would you say that that's better? 

speaker 2: Yes.

Thank you.. Is there anything specific about our solution that you find better than currently now? 

Like any general improvements that you think make quality of life a lot easier? 

Speaker 2: speaker 1: I think the fact that it stops you from doing something without like a pre-reck or the fact that it might pull you up if you're doing something that it wants to be in like composite with each other. Like that's a really good system because as you said, a May it doesn't actually pull you up on that. 

speaker 1: Right, okay. um And if our system were to be available, would you use it over? 

speaker 2: Yeah. 

speaker 1: All right. 

And how do you currently do your courseplay? Currently, 

speaker 2: I have a word doc that has everything in it that I need, that needs to be studied because I needed to sit down and figure out what needs to be done in every single stuff. 

speaker 1: Did you have to figure out all of like the course prerequisites for all those things to make sure they were in the right slot? 

speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah. 

speaker 1: And how long did that take you? 

Do you remember? 

speaker 2: took me like, you know, overall probably a few hours to sit down and do it the entire degree. 

speaker 1: And how long do you think it would have taken you for a similar system like this were to be in place? 

speaker 2: Maybe an hour. 

speaker 1: So you think it would save you a significant amount of time? Yeah. 

And is that something that you would consider to be valuable? 

speaker 2: Yes. I consider my time valuable. 

speaker 1: Thank you, thank you. Um Is there anything in particular that you think could be better? Like, keep in mind, this is just an MVP. 

So, like, it's quite bare bones right now, and we're working to put more courses than stuff in, but like anything that you notice immediately that you think would be improved or could be improved upon? 

speaker 2: I think the ability to not everyone wants to do full course of a semester. True. 

And I think the ability to plan a degree where you don't do four courses every semester and you do two courses, you do three courses would actually would enhance it. 

speaker 1: Yeah, that's absolutely something that we have considered. Obviously, the majority of students do do four, so that's the purpose right now, but yes, that is a good point. 

Thank you for bringing that up. On the whole, what are the strengths that I don't understand why I've written that last question? 

speaker 2: You've already asked me that. 

speaker 1: Yeah, so thank you for your time. 

speaker 2: No worries.
