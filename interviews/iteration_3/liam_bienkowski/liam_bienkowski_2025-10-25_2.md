### Interview 2
*Interview can be found [here](https://translink.com.au).*

Speaker 1: *Okay, do agree to have this interview recorded.* 

Speaker 2: 
>Yes, I do. 

Speaker 1: *So today I just want to ask a few questions about UQ's existing systems and also about the solution that you have just seen. So the 1st question that I have is what about the current system at UQ is so sluggish?* 

Speaker 2: 
>What do you mean by current system?

Speaker 1: *Like, the current system of enrolling into courses and choosing like major specialisation. It's like choosing how you're going to go through your course in general.* 

Speaker 2: 
>Um, I think the problems with the current system are that there's no real guidance to it at all. It's all core specific, as in like, you know, you see a course, like, and like COMP1100. You know, it has certain prereqs, it has certain requirements and times it's offered. Um, and you have to work that out for every single course for your entire degree. Um, by going directly to the course, which can be hard and then figuring it out from there. It's all very clunky. 

Speaker 1: *Yeah, so do you believe that our solution is more effective than the current system?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Yes, I do. 

Speaker 1: *Would you elaborate on why?* 

Speaker 2: 
>I think it centralises everything in one place and um, allows like you do visually and like efficiently create plans. Um, regarding like course progression. Um, and you can do it as many times as you want, so you can set up multiple plans, you can, uh, Set up like test ones or ones for certain circumstances. It's all there. It's like allocate for timetabling. all in one spot. It handles all the prereqs for you, like whether you can and can't do something, it will block you. Um. You don't have to worry about, like, actually researching everything because, like, at least from what I've seen, uh, the UQ, like, system, my SI-net will let you make a mistake. Um, and then it's your problem to deal with it. 

Speaker 1: *Yeah, awesome. So, dip for a system of singular, um, of singular tab, core selections, and if so, why?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Could you elaborate on singular tab or sections please?

Speaker 1: *So in the course collection system. Would you prefer to like do you prefer a system where you've only got to use one Chrome tab, for example?* 

Speaker 2: 
>One Chrome tab, as in like one uh, like currently current allocate system? Yes, I would. 

Speaker 1: *Would you elaborate on why for that.* 

Speaker 2: 
>Um, it's easy, easily accessible and simple. It just web browser. Um, You know, everyone has it. You don't have to install like any app or other clunky system. 

Speaker 1: *Right. Um, Moving on now. Um. So just comparing the 2, Is a one tab system more effective for you than having several tabs open at once and if so, why?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Uh, it is more effective because uh, it's all in one spot. You don't have to worry about, like, let's say with current course selection, having, like, up to 5 to 10 tabs open at once, each with course prereqs, and like course timetables, and when they're offered, and if you miss anything, it all breaks. It's just all all right there in one single web page. That's better to organising it. 

Speaker 1: *Yeah, um, that's in abstract sense as well. Um, like going beyond just course planning and more instead of your personal preferences with your computer. Do you prefer just having one tab open? Over numerous tabs and if so, why?* 

Speaker 2: 
>I prefer having um one tab open. Because it. Uh, means one, uh, there's less battery and memory usage from the browser, and 2 it's less likely I'm going to lose things. 

Speaker 1: *That makes sense. Um, do you personally see any benefits in having several tabs open for course planning?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Several benefits. Um, none explicitly. Beyond it being necessary to access multiple things, like if it can be avoided, I'd like it to be avoided. 

Speaker 1: *Great. Um, And so like just by an extension, what do you find beneficial then about having only one tab open at the time?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Uh, beneficial, less battery usage. My browsers tend to use tend to use up a lot of battery if you have a lot of tabs open and memory. This doesn't happen if there's one tab open. 

Speaker 1: *Right. Um, Moving on. Um, how much time do you currently spend on core selections per semester?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Um, I'd say I spend about, Well, I guess 4 to 5 hours, but it's usually spread over quite a large period of time, uh, and can vary as well, like in terms of asking people if they've done the course before, how it's like, doing the research, constructing course plans, just thinking about it, about 4 to 5 hours, but like, that's a number. 

Speaker 1: *Yeah, and just touching on the fact that it's spread over a lot of time. Is that often a challenge to deal with because you need to go back and try and re-access the same information you were looking at before?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Yes. 

Speaker 1: *Yeah, great. So do you think that this new system will significantly reduce that time that you need to spend?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Yes, I believe it will. 

Speaker 1: *And how come?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Because, uh, it's all in one place. You don't have to, like, let's say, uh, look up tabs you recently had opened or history pages you recently had opened. You don't know how to access anymore. Um. You. You know where everything is and you can find it again easily and you can save plans. So, like your current thing that you're working on, you can find it. Again, easily, you have to rebuild it from memory with times you hope you remember where they are. 

Speaker 1: *Yeah, and at the very least. Do you believe that this system will reduce the hassle of the current system?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Yes. 

Speaker 1: *Would you be able to elaborate on why?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Uh, same thing as previous answers, uh, it's just convenient. Uh, you don't have to, like, firstly, you don't have to, like, look up what courses you need to pass your degree. Then look up, what, um, Like when you can do them, all the prereqs, and then like somehow jump all them all together into a course plan. 

Speaker 1: *Yes, and so. Overall. Um, with this new system, which feature do you think is going to save you the most time and is going to like be the most useful out of everything that you've seen?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Um, it would be the timetable creation. Part of it being that you can um, let's say, create a timetable. Uh, using course profiles, and turn using like the course descriptions that you have in there, and it will automatically adjust it based on watch, uh, prereqs are in place, what courses you have done, and when you're trying to take the course. 

Speaker 1: *Awesome. Final few questions now. Um, if our system were to be available. Would you use it over whatever method you are currently using and as a part of this answer, could you mention what you're currently doing?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Um, okay, so firstly, what I am currently doing, uh, is the old, is my gripe with the old current, current system, which is, uh, firstly, look up what courses I need to pass my degree. Uh, then look up their prereqs, um, and then use that and like when they're when they're available and then use that to create like, A plan. Um, that's what I currently do, what I would do instead. Um, When this system is just, use it as, You've described to me. I would, um, When it's time to do course scheduling. I would go in. Obviously, I'd have to independently look up what courses I need to do, um, as part of my degree. And then once I've like decided on, let's say, what courses I'd like to do in certain times, like if I see a course I like and want to do 1st. Um, I, look, I plug them into the system to get the prereqs, and then, um, build a timetable. 

Speaker 1: *Right. Um, what about our solution, specifically, do you find better than what you do now?* 

Speaker 2: 
>Um, being able to create an actual schedule. Um, like, Like being, like, being able to create a stranger wall for me, in terms of courses, that's definitely better than what I do now, which is just create a list and how it works. 

Speaker 1: *Right. Um, is there anything in particular that you would that you think could be better? Um, in the solution or Or that your personal method does better. Overall.* 

Speaker 2: 
>Things that could be done better. Um, I would say uh, maybe have some buttons or presets in there. For certain degrees. Let's say, um, you're doing a double degree in bachelor of law and bachelor of computer science, um, it could be, or like maybe a single bachelor of law. It would be good to be able to have a preset and error that has all of the registered courses you need to do to pass that degree, and potentially, uh, like an allocate system, that generates an automatic timetable for, for you. It. Um, could, It could do the same thing. 

Speaker 1: *Great. And final question. On the whole, what other strengths that would influence your shift? from an old system. Like what would actually get you moving up to the new system?* 

Speaker 2: 
>What would get me moving? Um, it's ease of access. The fact that it's all consolidated in one portal, um, and very simple to use, would. Definitely motivate me to move to it over my current system. 

Speaker 1: *Well, thank you very much for your time today.* 

Speaker 2: 
>Thank you, thank you.
