- It's taken him about a minute to pick his comp sci degree and major.

- First thing to note is the scrolling is a bit annoying.

- (Noting the tabs are broken because of degree structure changes, this has since been fixed)

- Making a new plan had an OK response time, under a minute

> I think you should highlight courses you have already selected there
(We have since done this, now they are greyed out)

- You cannot delete a plan yet

> Does it save my plans?
- Not immediately obvious the plans are saved

- **Initial load time is really bad**

- Noting symbols or colours for courses (listed in left side) for courses
- This should be **yellow** for prereqs, and **red** for incompatible

- Unintuitive to find extra information about courses
> If you hadn't told me there was a way to show information, I wouldn't have known

- Intuitive to click to the UQ course page (external link) once you have selected the course you want

- (Can't deselect a course, this has since been added as a cross top right)

- (Ordering unassigned courses in the left bar by year, this has since been added)
- Folders for similar courses so you can easily find what you want

- Searching for courses (in category)
Search filters have since been added, including a course search.
There is an argument for adding an unlimited course search.

- Ability to add any course to the system
> Would allow this to be used by more people in more degrees

> I reckon a recommended structure is good
- PDF course planner imports might be useful, AI

- Assigning courses to specific program_requirements
