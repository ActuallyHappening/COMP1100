# Open question:
Patrick: *Tell me about any difficulties you have faced in choosing courses to enrol in.*

Charlotte: 
> Oh ok- I think the most difficult things involving my courses were the fact that there were so many options I had to choose between. I had to carefully pick a selection of courses that would not overwhelm me and yet meet the requirements for my course or major. It was quite stressful for me because unlike other degrees, which only had a limited list of courses to choose from, I had to somehow pick only several out of a few hundred - because the bachelor of science is one of the largest courses at UQ

# Closed question:
Patrick: *Was the process of choosing courses for your degree difficult?*

Amelia: 
> Yeah, I did have some difficulty in choosing the correct courses during both semesters this year. I have been working towards a mechatronics specialization for my vertical engineering degree, and with the limited elective slots, I have been trying to complete mandatory courses this year. Last semester was pretty straight-forward with the information I found on the UQ website , that being 3 engineering introductory courses and math - but I would have really appreciated some extra information about the differences between MATH1071 or MATH1051. The only difference I spotted at the time was that 1071 had "Advanced" out the front of the name. Even though I did well in 1071 last semester, I slightly regret my choice. I picked 1071 from the name and with minimal information about the course's structure. It would have been quite helpful to learn about how to navigate the past ECPs and degree outlines earlier. For this semester, it was a lot easier but I still had a difficult time with course selection even after speaking to the Academic advisors about it. The co-requisites and pre-requisites for a course limited my choices of mandatory subjects which lead me to use up an elective slot which I have been trying to save for future.
