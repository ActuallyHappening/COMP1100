You
Do you try to take courses with your friends where possible?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Yes

You
Is this a significant factor in choosing your courses or would you say it's something that you try to do after you've selected?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Something I try to do after I selected, especially with the order in which I do my courses

You
Yeah, okay. Did you know that SI-Net has a built-in way to share timetables?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Not SI-Net that specifically no

You
Oh, it's the builtin timetable app in the UQ system, that has a way to share timetables

Noah Joel Schmidt
I knew that must've been like you know somewhere because I've seen some external apps so not specifically just a timetable app that's cool

You
Yeah, okay so no, you did not. Is this a system that you would use often if you did know about it.

Noah Joel Schmidt
Probably not, no

You
Yeah, okay. Do you think it'll be beneficial if there's a way you could collaborate prior to selecting courses or do you confer with friends?

Noah Joel Schmidt
I already confer with friends

You
Have you planned your courses for the upcoming two terms?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Not fully, but most of my courses

You
Okay, do you worry that planning too far in advance isn't useful

Noah Joel Schmidt
Planning extremely precisely is not useful, but some weak planning is good

You
And is this why you haven't planned precisely for the upcoming two terms?

Noah Joel Schmidt
No, that is a separate reason

You
Okay, why have you not planned every course the upcoming two times?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Comes out still making decisions

You
Okay, when planning in advance how likely do you think your preference will change over time which will change your course plan?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Moderately likely

You
Yeah, okay and have you planned any courses at all more than two terms in advance?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Yes

You
Which courses and why?

Noah Joel Schmidt
I've planned my complex analysis functional analysis. I've planed my courses for my computational science one precisely because I know those are the ones I'm quite interested in/the ones that I know I need to do. There are other courses I'm less sure of that, but I'm still deciding if I like them or not.

You
And when you say need to do is this because it's a core class or it's in the major that you think you're going to graduate with?

Noah Joel Schmidt
My major or my minor

You
Yes, okay, and have you planned all your courses yourself or have you relied on a UQ advisor for example a course planner or a person?

Noah Joel Schmidt
No advisor

You
Have you use the UQ course planner at all?

Noah Joel Schmidt
I have looked at it, yes. But it's efficacy to see it goes down a lot when it comes to later semesters

You
I see so change tack a little bit. Would you like to see your previous participants? Of course can leave a note or a summary of the course for future students? For example you.

Noah Joel Schmidt
Yes, that would be very nice

You
So would you read short opinions of courses that you were thinking of taking?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Yes, yes, I would Although It depends on the way it's organised but generally I would be open to it

You
Would it matter if these opinions were from professors or students which would you prefer?

Noah Joel Schmidt
I would like those

You
Okay

Noah Joel Schmidt
If I have to pick one

You
No I was just asking your opinion. What about tutors would tutor factor into that as well? Would you prefer?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Would be probably one of the highest opinions with them above

You
Would you like a system similar to ad stem prior to choosing courses understand what actually happens in the course?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Similar to stem in what way?

You
But I guess that's enough for you to decide, but I've never used them personally

Noah Joel Schmidt
That is slightly Sounds very good for what it is meant to be But how that applies to like a course plan I'm not sure but like a general communal platform where you can choose by courses to hear people's opinions would be a useful thing yes

You
Yeah, okay and so would you participate in a system where eight of the students by writing a short note or summary if you wanted?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Yes, I would

You
And would you prefer a sister make staff a present not professor or not present as in moderated by UQ?

Noah Joel Schmidt
I would like one Question

You
We can skip this

Noah Joel Schmidt
I think I would like one without them

You
Interesting, okay? Why?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Because it would allow the tutors why can't staff I guess

You
Loud

Noah Joel Schmidt
It allows people to shadow opinions and thoughts from the course without any worries about how it might affect that assesses

You
Interesting Okay, trying to check again have you chosen your major and or minor?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Yes

You
How are your courses? Credit counted towards your major

Noah Joel Schmidt
First, the ones that counter towards my major were chosen And then enough redundancy in terms of courses that I enjoy were also added in there that I decided I wouldn't want to do some specific

You
Pakistan

Noah Joel Schmidt
electives that give towards my major that other electives would apply to that

You
So when you say electives, do you mean general electives?

Noah Joel Schmidt
No, I mean electives within my taking credits for general electives or program electives and applying them to various other various classes within my course

You
What do you mean by applying them to classes or courses because you're either get credit for a course by doing it or not? What do you mean by that?

Noah Joel Schmidt
So if I am completing a major that has a choice of multiple electives that I need to complete a sudden amount of this list of electives Then I'll complete then the plan to complete more than what is necessary so that if I decide I do not like a specific class then I can choose not to do it and still have enough glasses

You
Good thanks for clarifying that and sorry. Do you know what courses you need to complete in order to finish your major?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Yes

You
Good and a guess more critically if you change majors starting from next term, what would happen in terms of your course? Credit points? Do you know?

Noah Joel Schmidt
All the ones I have right now Except for one class, which transfer over

You
Interesting so you understand that now for top your head thank you but it help you to have a way to create and compare multiple plans if you decided to switch majors or is this not a concern for you?

Noah Joel Schmidt
It probably would have been helpful while organising however I have memorise the difference majors enough that it is no longer necessary

You
Interesting and so how likely do you think it would be for you to change majors now?

Noah Joel Schmidt
Slightly likely I don't give it a good 25%

You
Okay, thanks Noah for your time
