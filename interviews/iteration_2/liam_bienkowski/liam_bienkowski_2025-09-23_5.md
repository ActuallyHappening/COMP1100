Liam: *Alright, Anton, do you agree to have this recorded?* 

Anton: 
>Ah, Yep

Liam: *Okay, so firstly, I would like to ask you, does our solution show you all the relevant information for your courses?* 

Anton: 
>It does, yes. 

Liam: *Um, and do you like the comment section being listed for each course next to its information?* 

Anton: 
>Um, I think it's very helpful. It makes navigating the whole page a lot easier. 

Liam: *Yeah, and so do you think, like, seeing other people's comments on the courses as well would help you with your, like, choosing what course you want to do?* 

Anton: 
>Yeah, so sometimes, like, the course profile might be a bit difficult to, um, actually understand what the course is about without having some student input in. So I think the compensation makes it very helpful. 

Liam: *Yep. And do you want any other links between each of the courses or would that, do you think they would overcomplicate it or is it fine how it is?* 

Anton: 
>Would you mind, just, like... explaining what you mean by links? 

Liam: *So, um, like with the courses. would it see more links here linking to other information?* 

Anton: 
>Yeah, I think that would be very helpful. Being able to just have all that information there rather than search around for it, probably would help. Especially like people who don't really understand how to navigate, courses and uni stuff. It would really help them with finding information on stuff that's important to them. 

Liam: *Yeah, great. So, do you feel it would be useful to comment, like, for you to comment on courses for future students in that manner then?* 

Anton: 
>Um, yeah, I think it would be. Commenting on courses could also give some coordinators some feedback. So they'd understand what the general consensus is around their courses are at the moment and then they can use that feedback to change certain things about courses. 

Liam: *Yeah, and so what incentive would you have to do that then?* 

Anton: 
>To be honest, I don't really have much incentive other than, oh, it would be nice to help out other students who are in the same situation as I am. 

Liam: *Yep, and so would you like a badge for students based on whether they're a tutor or lecturer?* 

Anton: 
>I think that would be helpful. Having an idea of what, um... Sort of relationship a user might have with a course. 

Liam: *Yeah. And so, would you want all people who give a review to be verified UQ students?* 

Anton: 
>Um, I think that would be very important, yes. Because if you have strangers doing feedback on courses that could lead to a lot of misinformation, and that's not very helpful. 

Liam: *So by extension, then, would you want people who are commenting on the course to have completed that course, or would you like word of mouth to also help spread it?* 

Anton: 
>Um, I think having people complete that course would be the most accurate. Obviously, with word of mouth, you'll have different vibes and whatnot. So, I think having a verification system is very important. 

Liam: *Yep. And so finally, just generally, what was like your favourite parts about this solution that's been implemented so far?* 

Anton: 
>So, I think everything's been laid out really nicely. Um, and the... UI is generally pretty... user friendly and self explanatory, so... it didn't take too long for me to get used to... 

Liam: *Yep, and one final question. Do you think that there's any room for improvement or any choke points that you had, no navigating this website?* 

Anton: 
>Um, maybe a few prompts giving instructions would be good. Yeah, sometimes it was a bit unclear, but... 

Liam: *Yeah, and so could you elaborate on that just for a second?* 

Anton: 
>Yeah, so maybe, for example, in the safe plans folder, you can give a brief description about what the function is supposed to do. And yeah, basically just explain to the user how to use it. 

Liam: *Yeah, OK, that makes a lot of sense. Well, thank you very much for your time today, Anton.*
