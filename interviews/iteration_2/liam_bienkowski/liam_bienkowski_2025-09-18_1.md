*Metro: Now approaching cultural centre.* 

Liam: *Now Alexander, Do you agree to have this interview recorded?* 

Alex: 
>Yes. 

Liam: *So the first question is, do you try and take courses with your friends when possible?* 

Alex: 
>Um, yeah, I'd say I do organise with my friends to some of my classes, I'd say it's a combination. Like, if it's... it's push really close to shove I like, prioritised by degree, and, um, that, but, like, it is a consideration, definitely. 

Liam: *So, would you say that it is a significant factor in choosing your courses or would you say it's something you try and do after you've chosen what course you want to do in the semester?*

Alex: 
>I'd say I, like, look at the subjects I want to do, and then I'm, like, I go to my friends, and, like, guys, this is probably, like, the best course of action for me, and, like, if you guys want to follow, like, you know, be good to organise. So, like, I reckon it's more after the fact, well, after I'd, like, looked at prerequisites. 

Liam: *Yeah. So, do you know that my timetable, the official UQ timetailing website, has a built in way to share timetables?* 

Alex: 
>Yes, I do know that. I've got a bunch of my friends on it. 

Liam: *So is this a system that you use often then, or you say it's something that's useful, or is it something that is useful for playing with your friends?* 

Alex: 
>Um, I'd say it's somewhat useful. Yeah, I do use it, like... I mean, I, I, like, take screenshots of the different type of tables to see where my classes line up with my friends. So, you know, I could say I would use it. 

Liam: *Yeah. Great. So would it be more beneficial if there was a way you could better collaborate prior to selecting courses? Or do you already confer with your friends to a reasonable extent before selecting courses?* 

Alex: 
>Um, I mean, before selecting courses, I think that, um, the timetable website is a bit, like, dodgy when it comes to like, I think, is there a way you can look at each other's plans? 'Cause I thought it was just after you've gotten your courses allocated, then you can see each other's timetables. So, yeah, beforehand, it's all just like purple, so there's no way to, like, visualise it. 

Liam: *Yeah, great. So moving on. Have you planned your courses for the upcoming 2 terms?* 

Alex: 
>No. I probably shouldn't, but, like, I know generally what I want to do next semester, but, yeah, no. 

Liam: *So, do you worry, then, that planning too far in advance isn't useful?* 

Alex: 
>Yes, I do, um, because things change, obviously. Yep. 

Liam: *Yeah, so when you're planning in advance, how likely do you think your preferences will change over time with which plan you've taken?* 

Alex: 
>I'd say there's, like, a good chance that it could change, like, on a per semester basis. Like, part of my degree is computer science, and I still don't know where I want to major in, um, there's, like, three of the majors I am still interested in, and I've changed which one I'm interested in each day, and so those will be different parts I'd have to, um, like, pick which classes I do to do, each one of those major. So yeah, I would say it does, it is still up in the air. 

Liam: *Yeah, so, have you planned any of your courses more than 2 terms in advance, either for, as you were saying, computer science, or for your engineering degree?* 

Alex: 
>Like, I don't have a setup plan. I have classes, I’d like to do sometime in the next 4 years, but no, I don't have a specific plan at all after like the next 2 semesters. 

*Metro: The next station is South Bank.* 

Liam: *Have you planned all of your courses yourself? Or have you relied on UQ course advisor or a course planner?* 

Alex: 
>Um, I, the, my primary source is myself, so I go and check the prerequisites of, like, the, um, specialisation I'm interested in, like, those subjects, see which ones are most beneficial, um, and also which ones I'd enjoy. Um, and yeah, which one I need to do to, as proper prerequisites of other subjects, and then afterwards, I go and look at a course plan to, like, compare everything. Yeah, okay, on track, just to make sure. 

*Metro: Now approaching South Bank*

Liam: *Yeah. So would you like to see a system where previous students of a course can leave a note, like, of summary of that course?* 

Alex: 
>Oh, yeah, that would be definitely, really good, because currently, like, the course subscriptions on a lot of the ones I see on the program's domain. They're really not insightful into what the course is about at all, especially, like, um, yeah, just on a general basis, but also, like, for example, in semester one, I was choosing between MATH1051 and MATH1071, and the descriptions were literally exactly the same. Even though, like, in hindsight, the subjects were, like, quite significantly different. 

Liam: *Yeah, so would, like, would, so would you be reading the short opinions of students?* 

Alex: 
>Yeah, definitely, yeah. 

Liam: *So, would you like to see a system similar to EdStem prior to choosing a course? Like, a discussion board or more like a system of, like, Google reviews, where it's just, like, a simple review left to better understand the course.* 

Alex: 
>I think reviews fits this sort of format better, because, like, a discussion board, like, I think would probably get out of hand, whereas, like, a review system, you can just, like, quickly. like looking at downloading an app on the App Store or like going to a restaurant, you can just kind of look at some reviews and be like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I get the gist of the subject. Yeah. 

Liam: *Awesome. Would you participate in a system where you aid other students?* 

Alex: 
>Yeah, I'd say so. Like, if I, but obviously, like, the review system, probably only if I, like, really enjoyed it or really didn't like the subject, it was just, like, an average subject, I probably wouldn’t leave a review. 

Liam: *Makes sense. And which for a system where core staff are present in the forum? Or not present in their work?* 

*Metro: The next station is Mater Hill*

Alex: 
>Wait what? 

Liam: *Would you prefer a system where core staff are present in the forums or not present, like, to moderate the discussions, like the reviews?* 

Alex: 
>I think, like, you could have, um, just like, yeah, well, obviously you have moderators, so like you don't have, um, people going haywire, but I think in terms of like the course staff, um, like, being involved with the reviews, I think they should be able to, um, like, respond, like a developer response on the App Store and stuff to certain, um, reviews. But, like, I don't think the course staff themselves should be able to remove things, 'cause then that just defeats the whole purpose. I think that's a job for, like, a separate team of moderators. 

*Metro: Now arriving at Mater Hill*

Liam: *Yeah, great. And a final few questions now. So have you chosen your major or minor?* 

Alex: 
>Well, I haven't declared my engineering one yet, but I have chosen one and computer science, no. 

Liam: *So, um, how are your courses credits counted towards that major then?* 

Alex: 
>Like, what do you mean? 

Liam: *Prerequisites, et cetera.* 

Alex: 
>Oh, well, currently in computer science, I've still got core courses to do for the next, like, 2 or 3 semesters. So I don't have to worry about like prerequisites for the major of computer science. But I've already started my prerequisites for my engineering major this semester because it's like there's only like 4 core courses and the rest is into specialisation. Yeah. Yep. 

Liam: *Do you know, of course, like, do you know then what courses you need to complete in order to do your major or minors?* 

Alex: 
>Um, I mean, it's online. There's a lot, but like not off the top of my head, but yes, I know where to go to look at it. I have to look them up to go and check, like, where my, on my degree, which subjects I need to do. 

*Metro: The next station is PA Hospital*

Liam: *And so have you considered what would happen if you were to change majors, like if you were, say, change when you're starting next term? And then what would happen to your course credits?* 

Alex: 
>I actually have thought about this because semester one, I was thinking of just dropping engineering and just going to computer science, and I searched, I was researching, like, credit transfers and stuff. So I have considered like what would happen and see if I could get credit for some of my courses to and cross over and stuff and look at precedent for different course credits, yeah. 

Liam: *And how was that?* 

Alex: 
>Once again, it looks like the same UI as the programs domain. It's quite old and a lot of the, um, I can't remember exactly why, but I remember it basically just didn't work like for my situation. I don't know if it was because I had a situation that didn't have any precedent for. But I just couldn't find anything, any useful information at all for some reason, and I'm sorry, I don't remember what the problem was. 

Liam: *And so then finally, would it help you if you had a way to create and compare multiple course plans to see how your course could play out?* 

Alex: 
>Yeah, that would definitely be really good, bud. Yeah, that would be very useful, yes. 

Liam: *Well, um, thank you very much. That's all we have time for.*
