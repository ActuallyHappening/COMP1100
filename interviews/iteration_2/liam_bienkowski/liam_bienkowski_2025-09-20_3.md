Liam: *Benjamin Oliver. Uh, would you like, do you agree to have this interview recorded?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes, I do. 

Liam: *Great. So I just wanted to ask you a few questions today. The 1st question is, do you try and take courses with your friends where possible?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>No. 

Liam: *Uh, could you elaborate on why?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um... I I think I can see my friends outside of my degree. So, I think, um, that where possible, I tend to focus on what, what course is best to take at the time rather than whether I have friends doing it. 

Liam: *Yep, so if it became convenient. Would choose, would trying to choose a course with your friends be a significant factor? Or would you try it? Would you say something that you try to do after selecting a course?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>It's something I try to do after selecting a course. If it happens great, if it doesn't, no problem. 

Liam: *Yeah fantastic. Um, so now, did you know that my timetable, the official UQ timetabling website, has a built-in way to share timetables?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I did know that. 

Liam: *And would say that this is a system that you would use often if you did know about it as you do. Um, and would you say that it's, and would you say that it's something that is useful for planning with friends?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes, yes, I would say it is useful for planning with friends. 

Liam: *Could you expand on why?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, it makes, uh, like comparing your timetable to your friends very easy and very quick. Um, especially since you can compare all of them, uh, compare it across, like each day of the semester. And anytime with one another. So it's just a very quick and easy solution, you don't have to like, constantly go back and forth with them about when's this, when's that, and updates in real time too. 

Liam: *Great. And do you think that'll be more beneficial if there was a way you could better collaborate prior to selecting courses? Or do you already confer with your friends prior to selecting a course to a reasonable degree?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, I already do before selecting to a reasonable degree. I would say it would be nice to have such a feature like in the within the planner timetable, but I'm personally not fussed. 

Liam: *If there was to be that feature then, um, would you make use of it or how much, and like, if so, how much?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I would make significant use of the feature, assuming my friends did it as well. 

Liam: *Yeah. Uh, and so now moving on to like your organisational abilities. Have you planned your courses for the upcoming 2 terms?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes. 

Liam: *Um. And so why have you done that?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, just because I want to, uh, be structured in how I do my degree. I want to know when I need to do certain courses. Uh, what courses I need to do to actually pass. Um, and like, get them like a map of prerequisites out. So. 

Liam: *Do you worry that planning too far in advance isn't useful?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um. For uni courses, I'd say no, just because of like prerequisite and difficulty. Um, and the fact that some courses aren't offered each semester. Like I'd say there is absolutely a use to planning ahead, even if it's used in the future. 

Liam: *Yep. And so when you're playing in advance, how likely do you think your preferences will change over time? Uh, which will then change your plan?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I would say it's quite likely. Um, And I'm open to that happening. It's, just, I still want to have the plan anyway. So there's something to work off. 

You: *Yeah, okay great to hear. Um, Have you planned any of your courses more than 2 terms in advance?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, not really. I have a rough overview of my degree, and what, courses I’ll need to do to pass and roughly when I need to do them. But, uh, I've not like explicitly planned out the semester, the semesters ahead Just of, ahead uh, of, this uh, year, this or year, next or year, next sorry, year, 2 sorry, times, 2 like times, you but said. like you said. 

Liam: *Yeah, and so, when you've been doing this then. Have you relied, have you planned all the courses yourself? Have you relied on a UQ advisor, or a course planner, or similar to build out this plan?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, Initially, Um, I initially, used the 1st year course planners available on UQ’s website, to uh, plan out my out initial my year. initial year. Um, beyond that, I have used myself and to a limited extent, limited some extent, some advice or things or I've heard about certain courses from other people to get an idea of how hard are they are and when would be a good idea good to do them in conjunction with other courses. 

Liam: *Great. Um, moving on to some other questions. Would you like to see a system where previous participants of a course can leave a note of a summary of that course?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes I would

Liam: *Uh, and would you elaborate on why, please?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I believe it would um, beneficial to see a very recent student perspective on the course, uh, any key things about it that you'd only know if you had just done it.

Liam: *Yeah, and so would you read short opinions of the courses you were thinking of taking from past students?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes, I would. 

Liam: *How much would this change the courses that you'd be taking, if at all?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>It depends on the message and to an extent the course, um, I'll use an example. There's a course that, uh, is normally taken in 3rd year Eng, ENGG3100. I've talked to several people doing it right now who say it's quite hard and quite demanding. Um, which, therefore, right now is making me try to plan doing what I view to be easier courses around it to reduce the workload. Um, sorry, if uh, comments gave that kind of, I guess, vibe from a course. That's how I plan my degree around it. 

Liam: *Interesting. So, if this was to be implemented, would you like to see a similar to EdStem prior to choosing courses, like a discussion board, or would you like to see something more similar to Google reviews, which just has a certain person's opinion without the possibility for collaboration?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I'd like to see a Google reviews style system. 

Liam: *And why would you like that?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I like it because I think it’s succinct. Um, like, the goal of these reviews should be just, um, broadly, how did you find the course? Any concerns over it? I don't think there needs to be much collaboration, and there can be multiple reviews for the uh, for the course available, so you can still get like multiple people's perspectives. 

Liam: *Yep, and uh, and would you participate in a system where you aid other students? And if so why?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, I would mainly because I would like others like to do it to me. Uh, so, I guess it's encouraging the use of it.

Liam: *That makes sense. And would you prefer a system where the course staff are present in the forums or not present in the forums?*

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I would say um, are present in the forums. I think I'm having them being able to comment as well, uh, would add a lot more depth, especially if, let's say for like, I use ENGG3100 as an example, large group project semesters, semesters where it didn't go well. There's a lot of, um, let's say, comments now saying, oh, the course didn't go well. The course coordinators are now there in the comments as well to, I guess, add their own perspective. It may not be agreed with by the students, but it's good to have both, so you can form your own opinion. 

Liam: *That makes sense. And now, looking more specifically at your course, have you chosen your major or minor?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I have chosen my major. 

Liam: *Yes, and so in doing so then. Uh, how are your current courses credits counted towards that major? Is that something that you have looked at?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>That is not something I've looked at. 

Liam: *Um, and so then building on that, do you know what courses you need to complete in order to be able to attain your major, like, just like to be able to move into it?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Uh, yes. I do. 

Liam: *And how did you find that?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, I found out by looking at, uh, on my course profile on the, uh, UQ website, uh, seeing what courses you needed to complete in order to, uh, gain the major. And then planning around that. 

Liam: *Yeah. Um, and if you were to change majors starting from next term. Do you know what would happen in terms of your credit points? And how easy it will be to change your major?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, vaguely. I know that certain majors within my degree would be easier than others because some have overlap. I'm just for reference, I'm doing an engineering degree, uh looking to go into mechanical. Um, I know mecratronic does a lot similar courses, civil does not. Or chemical, for example, so it would really depend on what I was trying to actually do as to how hard that would be. 

Liam: *That makes sense. And also, would it help you if there was a way to create and compare multiple plans? Uh, that so you could understand what the different credit requirements for majors might be?*

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes, I believe that would be helpful. 

Liam: *Uh, and would you elaborate on why?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, I think, if, I mean, I've always been quite, uh, set on what major I wish to do. But I believe that if I, for example, was not set on it, um, it'd be good to compare exactly what I needed to do regarding courses to accomplish it, uh, very easily, rather than having to like dig through the course codes and physically look it all up and then make my own individual planner. It would be good to just have that available. 

Liam: *And now just a final 2 questions. Um, we've been talking a lot about different, uh, , aspects that could be implemented into a future UQ digital solution. digital solution. Um, course planning, discussion boards, discussion boards, collaborating with friends. If such a software was to become a reality, would you like it in terms of a laptop capable website?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes, I would like it in terms of a laptop capable website. 

Liam: *Yeah, and so then, if it was to be, uh, and then how would you feel about it then, instead of a laptop cable website being a phone app instead.* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Um, I would be okay if it was both for a hybrid system, I would not be okay if it was exclusively a mobile app. 

You: *And why would that be?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Because I think you can get more functionality out of a laptops, laptop capable website. 

You: *Well, I think that is all we have time for today. Thank you very much, Benjamin Oliver.* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Thank you, Liam, thanks for having me.
