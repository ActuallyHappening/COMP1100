Liam: *Ben, Are you happy with this being recorded?*

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes 

Liam: *Okay so today, I just wanted to ask you a few questions about like your experience at UQ and enrolling into courses. So like firstly when you enroll into courses would you like to see a system where previous participants of course can leave a note of a summary of that course?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes, I think that would be quite useful 

Liam: *Why would it be useful?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Learn a student’s perspective, learn a  very recent student perspective I should say on what to expect the challenge of this course from the previous semester/year period. I think would be a lot more relevant a lot more precise, coupled with their general thoughts description 

Liam: *Why do you think that's not achieved then in the electronic learning profile?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Because I think the electronic learning profile has -  I don't know this but I assume it has standards it needs to meet in terms of what is it describing, what categories is the course and what learning objectives it is relative to the faculty. There's a lot of jargon in there, a lot of and/or for things like hurdles which make it quite hard to read and often times require clarification so just a short summary for someone who isn't trying to use technical jargon. And someone who recently took the course would be quite useful 

Liam: *Awesome. So moving on would you read short opinions of the course you were thinking of? Thinking of sorry would you read short opinions of course as you were thinking of taking from past students?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes 

Liam: *What would you be seeking to gain from that?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>General knowledge - sorry - A very recent perspective on what is the course? Like? What actually does it teach? To what degree does it go into certain things and I guess a general opinion of the difficulty I know that it's hard to predict per year but a recent student’s perspective on that part of the course would be quite useful. 

Liam: *Yeah that's interesting to hear. So in terms of actual implementation of this what type of system would you like to see? Would it like to be something similar to an EdStem discussion board or it be something more like a review system that you see on Google or something else.* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I think, I think in terms of how you view them, the review system on Google would probably be, I think one of the best ways to do it. That being said like there is some level of filter needed here so maybe like have all the tutors like at the end of the course just look through the responses and put them up. I think that would work but I think I would be pretty good. 

You: *So why do you prefer that over an EdStem style discussion board?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I think it means each view is individually trying to reflect rather than debate on a discussion board 

Liam: *Yeah, that makes sense* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>That's the difference really 

Liam: *But then, so would you prefer not to have a way of asking people more personalised questions or would you just rather have like frequently asked questions being answered?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I'm fine with frequently ask questions like specific to the course ones that you'd only really know or ask if you did it 

Liam: *That makes sense. If this was to be permitted, would you participate in a system where you could other students? like, Would you be leaving the reviews at the end of the semester or would you not be doing this?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I believe I would 

Liam: *What incentive would you have for that?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I guess, this sounds quite morbid, but warning people are about hard parts of the course that weren't entirely obvious from the outset

Liam: *Why wouldn't it be obvious?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Various reasons: bits of content usually can be harder or more detailed to learn certain bits of content on the exam tend to be tested for more frequently but you only know this once you're very deep into the course it's too late to pull back or unenroll. Certain assignments or projects being bigger requiring a lot more work or extra detail than is visible from the course profile those types of things 

Liam: *So would you say that the information that you're trying to get out of people here is already on the course profile?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>No 

Liam: *And so would you say that stuff like assignments are on the course profile and stuff like there's a general over on the course profile but it doesn't get specific* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yeah doesn't get specific. It's like an overview of what are you doing and that's about it. No description to what they would entail. At least nothing too detailed, not detailed enough and no like views from previous students as to what it actually feels like to do it. 

Liam: *If you had electives, would this inform your decision on what course you would take?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes, absolutely 

Liam: *In what manner?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I guess what to expect. If the elective isn't something too similar to my current courses I'm doing it'll be what actually to expect out of the elective. How difficult is it? And let's say for - I use a physics course that I'm doing right now as an example - how in depth do we go on certain topics? I might want to do like. Like for example in PHYS1002, special and general relativity which is something I am interested in and that's why I picked the course is as an elective; how in-depth do we go into that? Is it very in-depth? Is it lightly slipped over compared to the other parts of the course that kind of thing because sometimes people do courses not for every bit of it but for a certain part. 

Liam: *Yes so mate, going with that example of PHYS1002 you said that you were interested in the general special activity. Have you done that so far?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>No. On the course profile, it is in the later part of the course and there's no like- and you can't tell from the course profile exactly what it would entail in learning that. 

Liam: *Yes so for that course then for the stuff that you have done that's on the course profile, how well do you say that the stuff on the course profile is matching up in terms of weight time spent on it to the stuff that you're actually learning in class?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Not very well. It's- we've not covered anything in class that wasn't on the profile but it has no indication of how in-depth it is how much there is how what are the implementations of it and a lot of that can't be done on a course profile like exactly teaching the course but there's no indication of exactly how the course ends up being instructed and tell you:  Well, do it and get too far to back out 

Liam: *Yeah and so you're hoping then that a sort of discussion like review solution would help you in that in that fashion?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Yes 

Liam: *And one final question, and you kind of talked about this before but like or maybe providing some reasoning behind it would you prefer a system where course staff are present in the forums or not present?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I would prefer a system where they are present. Not to - assuming the post themselves are appropriate and meet UQ guidelines - not to delete any post but rather to I guess assuming there's any very popular posts or very outstanding ones to add their own opinion to kind of add a bit of I guess moderation if you will or correction. I'm not not that that any massive moderation or indeed potentially disagreement between them and the students but like I guess see them kind of correct each other, see both perspective quite good 

Liam: *Yes so and when it comes to the course staff like what level of oversight? Would it be all course staff or would it be just the tutors? Just the professors? What would you choose and why?* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>I believe both just because, I think they all have both both tutors and professors, equally familiar with the course and the contents and have valuable insight to I think they're all capable

Liam: *Okay, well, thank you very much for your time* 

Benjamin Oliver: 
>Thank you, thanks for having me
