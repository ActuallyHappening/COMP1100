Liam: *Okay, Jonathan Jesuthesan. Do you agree to have this interview recorded?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Yes. 

Liam: *So today I'm going to be asking you a couple questions about how you choose to enrol into courses at the University of Queensland.* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Uh huh. 

Liam: *So, the first question that I wanted to ask you is, um, do you try and take the same courses as your friends where possible?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Yeah, if I have an elective, then yeah, I would try and see, like if I have any other friends in the course. Or if I have any other friends in my degree, like, I'd try and do the same courses as them. So, like, because, you know, they're doing the same degree as me. So it's like, they probably know better than I do. What causes to take to like, you know, best path for you? So, yes, I do do that. 

Liam: *And so, like, on that as well, then would that be an incentive to study together as well? Is that what you're trying to say?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Yeah, yeah, 100%. 

Liam: *Yeah, so, um on to the next question then. Like, is this a significant factor when choosing your courses? Or would you say it's like something that you would try and do after choosing what courses you want to do in the semester?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Like, I'd say somewhere in between. Like, it's definitely a big thing I think about. But obviously, like, I don't just, like, disregard the courses I do need to get done just because I don't know anyone doing the course or whatever. But it definitely does help when I'm choosing the courses. To think about like friends or someone else who might be doing the course. 

Liam: *So could you like further elaborate on where your line might be drawn as to like that dichotomy?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Yeah. So like, I feel like it when I'm talking to friends who are in my degree, it definitely is a lot more of a decision in choosing my courses. Because like, they've got to follow the same course plan as me. So I'm much more likely to like think about what courses to do with respect to what they're doing  if they're doing the same degree. Whereas if it's a frame is not doing the same degree or it's taking an elective or something, then it probably takes more of backseat. in that case. But, yeah. Is that sort of answer that? 

Liam: *Yeah, so then moving on to the next question then, I guess, segueing right in: do you know that my timetable, the official UQ timetable website, has a built-in way to share timetables?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Yes, I did. 

Liam: *So therefore, like, how does this help you in any ways if you've used it?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>I've used it a bit, but. It's kind of like useless, in my opinion. Like, I think it's a bit clunky, the way it works. I'm just not a huge fan of the whole timetable site in general. It's just a bit hard to use, I think. Like, messing around with the weeks in all weeks and then having to go to like the connections and sorting it out that way, I find this a bit clunky to use. So, yeah, I don't use it probably as much as I, yeah. 

Liam: *Would you say, though, that such a software has definitely has applications and can be expanded to other applications in future?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Yeah, yeah, 100%. If it's done properly, I think it's a really good good tool and a really good thing that could be used. I just think it's probably not executed the greatest right now. And I don't know whose fault that is. But like… like, yeah, I just think it's probably it's probably not great right now, but it's definitely it's a good concept. I think the ideas there, but it could use some work. 100%. 

Liam: *Awesome. So, then, just further elaborating on that, is this a system that you would use often if you did, like, like obviously that you know about it. And would you say this is because like it's useful for planning with your friends or just because it's more of a gimmick?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Yeah, I think the way I currently treat it is a bit of a gimmick because it's sort of something you set up and it's like, it's cool for like a bit at the start of semester and you forget, right? Whereas I feel what I do a lot now is just sort of like talk to friends and ask them to they're around and whatnot. Like, um, it's not that much planning around timetabling. I think it's. I don't know what exact reason that's for, but I find it definitely was treated a bit more like a gimmick. Had it maybe been better, maybe it's like, you can add it to your phone. Like, there's like an app through it, maybe something like that, which makes it easily accessible or like more um, I guess like more… what's the word? Interactive in a way, I guess, for, like, the student to use, then I think it would probably be a bit more of a staple in, like my usage, I guess. I just feel the way it's currently set up, makes it a bit of a gimmick, the way I sort of used it. 

Liam: *Yeah. The next question is, do you think it will be more beneficial if there was a way that you could better collaborate prior to selecting courses? Or do you already confer with your friends prior to selecting courses in a way that you think is like works well enough?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Yeah, I think. I think the way I currently do is like the best with what we currently have due to preferencing. Because, like, in terms of choosing classes, it's not certain because you have to preference your classes. So it's like, you don't exactly know where you're going to end up. So I think that might just be a natural limitation of the fact there's so many students. So I think that limits the ability you can sort of like confer with other people and be like, choosing the same course in the same classes. But outside of that, I think maybe it would be helpful to, like, maybe other people in your degree or something being able to just like, um see what other people are doing or something like that, maybe like some chat, whatever. If there was a better, yeah, way a better collaborate that way maybe it would be helpful. But, yeah, I think I personally, at least, I definitely do still confer with my friends. 

Liam: *In an ideal world where there are no bounds whatsoever on what is possible, like with the uni software or like logistically, what would you see as being the most optimal solution?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Yeah, I think… in terms of that, I think if we could get rid of preferences, I think that would make it a lot easier to share classes with friends and then that way, like, sharing the course would be a lot easier because, like, it can differ a bit if you're in like different pracs or whatnot. Like, I know for me with labs, like lab reports can be like two weeks apart if you're not in the same class. So it's like, you can't really work on them together, right? If it's two weeks apart. So, like, I think that would make it a lot easier to, like, be dead set on, like, yeah, I can choose this course, because I know I'm gonna be able to do it with someone I know. Like, the certainty. Whereas it is still a bit of a gamble. I think that's the biggest attractor in that sense and the biggest like logistical challenge. Outside of that, I guess like, if there was someone to like connect with more people in your course, like, that could be helpful as well, when you're picking like your classes and like that. Like, obviously logistical challenges, like, there's so many students and whatnot. I don't know if that's possible, but yeah, outside the boundaries just what's possible, that would probably be my recommendation. 

Liam: *Yeah. And it's now just like thinking more generally. Um. If we were to develop some form of solution where you could plan your course structure and then save a course plan and then come back and view it on your phone. Oh, sorry, not on your phone, but just like in general. What would be like the most optimal or like prime medium that you would like to see this go through? Would it be like on a computer? Would it be on a phone? What would it be and why?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>For me, phone. Like, to like, answer that first bit. I prefer phone over a computer because with computer, I find, you have to log in. Like, it's through a website. It's often a bit, like, clunky that way. Phone is like, really easy just like, one swipe, click on the app. It should already be open because it's already logged in. I find that's a lot easier to access. And like, the easier it is to access, the more likely I'm going to use it more and, like, yeah, it's just better for me in that sense. And, yeah, I'd prefer it to be like a sort of one stop kind of thing, like, as much in one app as possible, as opposed to having like, like the thing with the timetable app is it's different from like Blackboard. It's different from my UQ. Like it's a it's a completely different app to the rest of the apps on like the UQ, like, um whatever you want it like a portal, right? So like, um it's like I think it's a lot. It'd be a lot better to have that sort of like centralised in one place have it, maybe add it to another app that's already existing or just combine them. That would probably be the most optimal way to use this kind of program. 

Liam: *Yeah. And so one final question then, if your optimal way of implementing wasn't able to be done, so for you, if it could only be done on a computer rather than a phone, would this be a major detraction from your experience and why or why not?* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>Personally a little, just because there's like alternatives a little bit. I think, like, I guess, like directly talking to people, just sort of asking them for timetables and whatnot. Like, that sort of thing is an alternative. I think there's enough. Like, I guess it's just like, that's the same amount of effort as it is to maybe do something on a computer. So for me personally, yeah, I would find it a little bit detracting just because the convenience, I think, is what sets that apart from what I currently already do. Like, I think it's not that I can't do it now. It's just that it takes longer and it's a bit harder. It takes a bit more effort. So, um, like, I wouldn't say completely. I think still, um there's probably some merits to the online app, but just in terms of like, simplicity, I find the computer website driven ones tend to be a bit more complex. So, um, out of personal preference, I would say, yes, it would affect my sort of incentive to use the app. 

Liam: *Okay, well, thank you very much for your time, Jono.* 

Jonathan Jesuthesan: 
>That's all right, Liam.
