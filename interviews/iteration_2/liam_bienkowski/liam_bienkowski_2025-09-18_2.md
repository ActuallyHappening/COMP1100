*Interview can be found [here](https://uq.sharepoint.com/teams/Section_7560_62502/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=/teams/Section_7560_62502/Shared%20Documents/Mon_9am_Team_10/liam_bienkowski_audio_recordings/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-18_2.mp3).*

Liam: *Okay, Jonathan, do you agree to have yourself recorded?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yes, I do. 

Liam: *Great. So the 1st question I would like to ask you today is, do you try and take courses with your friends where possible?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yes, I do often try to take courses with my friends, especially if they're doing, like, same degree or similar degree to me. Um, yeah. 

Liam: *So would you say this is a significant factor in choosing your courses or would you say it's something that you tried to do after selecting your courses?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yeah, I think, um, for me mainly, it's significant when I'm like talking to people who are doing like a similar course structure to me. Like, it's like obviously the same degree as me or something. Because it's like we all have to complete the same units, the same courses by the end of our degree. So it's like the ordering of the courses is the main thing that, like, we try to align. Like, we're gonna do the same courses in the same semester. So like similar classes. So, in that case, it's like a really significant factor because it's like, if I wanted to take this prerec course, I'd try and do it at the same time, the same semester as someone else in my degree. or someone else who's doing that same course. But yeah, the other thing, place where I'd say it's significant is when I'm choosing electives, because of my degree, I have a fair amount of electives. So, if I was picking an elective, then, yeah, like, one of the factors is like, is anyone else doing that elective? That definitely does play a role for me as well. So, um, those, it is significant for like those two. 

Liam: *Awesome. Did you know that my timetable, the official UQ timetabling website, has a built-in way to share timetables?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yes, I did know that. 

Liam: *Yeah. And so, is this a system that you often that you say is useful when playing with your friends? Or is it more of a gimmick?* 

Jonathan: 
>To me, at least it's a little bit of a gimmick, just because I find it a bit harder to use. just a bit of like, um, like it's just a website. It's like signing in to my timetable. It was like a separate website and everything. I find it like a bit hard to use and it's just a bit a little bit useless for me because it's like, there's easier ways of finding out like timetables and like sharing with my friends, I think. So I just find it's like not the, it's not very streamlined. It's not the best way to do it. It's like requests and whatnot. Like it's a bit weird the way it's set up. And also the fact that it's like a website, like a laptop, website, online thing, doesn't really help in terms of like ease of use or ease of access. So like, for me in that sense, it's a bit of a gimmick. I feel like there's better ways to share courses and classes. Yeah. 

Liam: *Do you think it would be more beneficial if there was a way that you could better collaborate prior to selecting your courses with your friends through an online medium, provided by the university? Or do you already confer with your friends to an adequate level prior to selecting courses?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yeah, I think I already do confer, like, with friends, prior to course, dud, selecting courses, but I think, um, I think if it was, like, a lot easier to do, like, there was a, like, a better way of aligning it. Like also just with like the way to select courses and find out information about courses is a bit clunky, like with the course profiles and whatnot. like that UQ currently have. So like, I think, like if that was streamlined, it was a bit easier to just like look at like what courses aligned with like, you know, like actually, if there was an easy way to find out what prerequisite courses you needed. instead of having to like search through like 50000000 different websites. Like, if that person was just a lot more streamlined, and like, if there was like one place to do that, and then also communicate with others on like what courses they were doing based on like, because right now it's like, you find a course, and then it's like, they have to go do the same research you did about that course, to find out whether they can take that course, whether it's beneficial for them. Whereas, like, if, if it was, like, these are the courses you need to do, these are the courses that, like, are your program electives and that this is, like, you know, like general electives or whatever that, like, might suit your course that you can do with your current prerequisites? Like, it's all there. So it's a lot easier to sort of collaborate and talk about what courses need to be done where. Whereas right now it's just a lot of searching. So it like, you ask about one course. It could take, like, two days for them to actually, like, come back to you on, like, whether or not that's, like, a thing that could happen. Just because it takes so long to do it. And it's like, um, in that sense, it's a bit inefficient. It would be a lot easier to communicate and a lot better, in my opinion, at least, if it was sort of set up all in that same way. So, um, it's a lot, it would be a lot easier to use. Yeah. 

Liam: *Yeah. And so on that, have you planned your courses for the upcoming 2 terms?* 

Jonathan: 
>No, I have not. So I am, like, pretty bad at planning, to be honest. So I sort of like plan before the semester starts, what courses I'm doing. And speaking of, actually, this semester, I got my courses like quite late. Like, I hadn't got my courses in by the time timetable was opened. So like, I actually didn't really preference until like much later. Um, so, but yeah, I found that like, um, maybe if I planned a bit more, maybe if I looked at like my my course outline a bit, um, then it could be a bit like helpful to like, you know, like actually plan like 3 or 4 years in the future. Um, so not 3 or four, like, like the length of my degree, because, um, I found like that, like, um, maybe I'm just bad at planning, but like it's also just hard to find all that information, and it takes a while to, like, um, do that for the the 2 semesters that I um, need to. So, so it was a very long answer, but answer that. No, I have not started planning for the next two semesters. 

Liam: *Yeah, so do you worry that planning too far in advanced won't be useful?* 

Jonathan: 
>Like, Maybe it's like a cope, like a copium thing for me. But like a little because I'm like, things might change. Like, if I plan in, like, far in advance. But like to an extent as well, there are courses which I need to do for my degree, which are like non-negotiable. And then it's like, if I did plan around it, maybe it would be easier. But, um, to the same vein, like, elective-wise, like, I don't know whether I need to prioritise GPA at some points, or whether I need to, like, you know, whether I can just take a fun elective, or maybe I want to go into an elective that might be more interesting or helpful for me later. Like, depending on that, I'm like, what I'm thinking now might not be the same as what I'm thinking next year, right? Because I would have had some experience on whether the course is actually hard. So there's a little bit of like, it's not very useful, but I think on the whole, definitely, I think do, I think planning out my course, like for the future, probably would be a good idea. I think en masse. Yeah. 

Liam: *So when planning in advance, how likely do you think your preferences will change over time? and will change a plan?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yeah. So I think I talked about it a little bit already, but the main, like, the main thing I'd be planning is like core courses and prerequisite courses I need to do for the future. And then probably like in terms of planning, what I'd be looking at is like, where can I take program electors? Where can I take like, um, like, just general electors or whatever? Um, and I think general electives would probably be where my preferences change a bit. I don't think any other, like I don't think elsewhere it would change. So I think it'd be like very few courses, like maybe like 3 courses per year or something, that might fluctuate. But like, yeah, on the, on for the most of it, I don't think my preferences will change for like planning it. But there, I think there's a little bit of, like, liberal support to me, yeah. 

Liam: *Yeah, and so like on that, have you planned any courses more than 2 terms in advance?* 

Jonathan: 
>I have not. No. Apart from oh, there's an exception 2 of my courses because I'm looking at it into med. I know I have to do 2 prerequisite courses for med. So I have planned those 2 courses, but anything around that, I have not really even looked to plan with that. 

Liam: *And so have you planned all your courses yourself or have you relied on a UQ advisor or like a course planner or something else?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yeah, so so far, I've done all of it myself. I've tried to get other people to do it for me, but, um, no one really wants to do it for me because I got to be fair enough. It's just, you know, what, extra work. So, um, but yeah. So like, yeah, I've done it all myself, basically. But I have tried to get help, I'd say. Yeah. 

Liam: *And so would you like to see a system where previous participants of a course can leave like notes of a summary of that course?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yeah, I think that would be pretty good. Like, um, yeah, just like advice, for the course, because, like, sometimes it's like, um, like, yeah, I think of, like, also just like how they approach the course, because, like, if you're approaching a course as an elective as opposed to, like, a core course, you'd probably have a different experience. Like, whether you think, like, I thought it was gonna be easy. It was like easy-ish, but like I started to put in a bit of work. Like that kind of thing. I think like that would be helpful for like how to look at the course and like maybe when to take it. Um, as opposed to like, um, just like this course, like just a summary of like what was in the course, because like, I guess like the, like content wise, because I think that'd be like somewhat helpful, but like, I think more so like workload and like, um, when this might be a good course for like I took this in my 2nd year for this reason, as a general elective, or something like that. Then I think that would be a helpful way of presenting feedback from past participants. 

Liam: *Yep, so, like, extending on that, then, would you personally read short opinions of courses that you were thinking of taking from past students?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yeah, yeah. I think definitely, if it was like in that format and it was from past students who'd done the course, I think definitely, yeah, I would definitely read that prior to like thinking about courses. 

Liam: *Would you like a system similar to EdStem, where you can have a discussion board, or more like Google reviews, prior to choosing courses, as to understand what actually happens in the course?* 

Jonathan: 
>Um, I think... I think EdStem could be. It could work, definitely. Um, like, I think if you like eliminate, if you can find somewhere to limit, like, clutter, probably be the only concern. Because, like, I think Google reviews is useful, but, like, it can be very, like, um, like, shallow and, like, a bit, like, there's not much information there, I think, in Google reviews, like, you don't learn much from Google reviews, of course. I think EdStem could be a good idea. The only like concern I'd be looking at is like, is there just like useless information? Are people just talking about random stuff or like, like lots of people get into like lots of nitty-gritty detail. Like, is there some way to sort, like, like the more concise ones, like maybe endorsed reviews? Like, I don't know if that's, like, obviously, like, I don't know much about this, but, like, like, that would be the only concern. say otherwise EdStem would be a good way to go about it. My only concern would be maybe it's a bit cluttered, something like that. Some way to deal with that. Yeah, yeah.

Liam: *So would you participate in a system where you can aid other students?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yeah, 100%. Like, I mean, I've read a lot of people lose. I done the course. I might as well. Leave it over review. Give back to the community. Because I'm like a good person like that. Yeah. 

Liam: *And so would you prefer a system where course staff are present in the forums or not present in forums?* 

Jonathan: 
>Um, I think I think them being present, I think it's got to be maybe anonymous or something. I don't think there should be any like, I don't know, because if they were bad course coordinator, or the course staff is bad. I think it should be said, right? I don't think, you know, like freedom of speech or whatever, First Amendment. So, but yeah, I think, so like, I don't think there should be any like penalty. I don't think any, I don't think anyone should have any like should. think any of the past students should hold back, right? But I think, and also, I don't think course staff should be giving reviews on their own course. Like, but maybe whether it's like the course stuff, like replies to something or like, um, or like maybe moderation in a way. Like, I don't think they should have a huge presence. Um, and I don't think they should be giving the feedback for it, but maybe, um, like, there's there's probably some way that could be incorporated, but for me, the big thing is just make sure, like, the students don't feel like they have to, um, like, restrain any part of the review of the course because of, like, the course stuff, yeah. 

Liam: *Yep, so have you chosen your major or minor if you have one?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yeah, well, I'm doing a bachelor of biomedical science, which is sort of like a bachelor of science with a major in biomedical, basically the same thing. So yeah, I've basically chosen my major now. 

Liam: *Yeah, so with that, how are your current course credits countered towards your major? Have you had a look into that?* 

Jonathan: 
>That's a good question, actually. Um, I haven't really... All I know is like they're a core courses and then they're like core selectives or program electives or something. Um, and then, so then I can like, there's like a, you can do like a, there's actually a little bit of flexibility with how many of those you can do, and then you can also do some general electives. And I know, like, as long as I stay within those, like, unit numbers, um, I think I get the credits corded. like towards my degree. Um, yeah. 

Liam: *So do you know what courses, uh, course credits get counted towards your major?* 

Jonathan: 
>I know that I can find what courses there are. I don't know them right now because it takes a while and like, there's a whole, like, it's kind of like cluttered the way to get there. So I don't currently know, but I know there is a way to find it. And if I tried hard enough and put some time towards it, I probably could find the courses, yeah. 

Liam: *So if you were to decide to change majors, do you know what would happen in terms of your course credit points? Have you looked into that?* 

Jonathan: 
>I haven't, and I actually don't know what will happen. That's actually a really good question. Because I think, I don't know, I've heard some stuff, but I've never actually looked into it properly, so no. That's actually something I could look into. But yeah. 

Liam: *Yeah. So would it help you if there was a way to create and compare multiple plans to understand these different prospects?* 

Jonathan: 
>Yeah, that actually would, because I think, like, part of us just having it all in one place, because, like, a lot of the way, like, I know I've already talked about it, but, like, if you're looking at, like, on your, your degree website, um, you're looking at, like, um, these are the core courses or whatever. These are like the electives. But you have to go to the course profiles to find out more about them. You have to, like, maybe look at, like, um, like units. You have to look at when those things are available, what semester, right? Like, because they're not always offered all the time. There's like certain other requirements. can't always take it, right? So like, I think having that in somewhere where you can plan it all and like compare plans, be like, does this plan actually work? For starters, right? Like, is this something I don't like? And then you can also access course profiles from that, that kind of thing. Like, that would be a lot more helpful and be a lot better for comparing those kind of plans. Yeah.

Liam: *Yeah, and so just finally on that, um, if such a solution was to be developed, um, how do you think, um, this, it would fit into the UQ community? Would it, do you think it would spread through word of mouth or would you like the U, like UQ to promote it through like the Welcome to UQ page for new students? What would you like seen?* 

Jonathan: 
>Um, I think it should definitely be promoted by UQ. I think that kind of thing, because I think it's probably a big thing, because like right now the way you sort of find out about your courses, it's like, it tells you to do like 5000000 different steps to like complete all this stuff, right? Like when you're like, um, like, yeah, Welcome to UQ, whatever it's called. And it's like you're doing that. And it's like, it's a little bit of just like a pain in the arse. It's like, oh, um, like, sorry. Like, it's just to like go through all of it. Um, like, cause it's like there's like so many different things you need to do. Whereas like if this was promoted as like 1st thing, right, you just need to set up this one thing, right? You're already, like, they're getting you thinking about your course plan. like you already planned your, like your course there and then, right? And it's like you know how to do it if anything changes in the future, right? Because that's done first. What if it's a word of mouth thing, right? It's like you can set up like, like whatever, like your 5000000 different ways of doing it. Like, each person will do it slightly differently if it's not promoted, like, when you 1st come here, right? So then it becomes a problem later when someone tells you word of mouth. Like, oh, use this thing, because you're like, it's a bit late now, right? Like, I've already done some of it or I don't want to start. I don't want to change the way I'm currently doing it, right? Like, that kind of thing. So I feel like it needs to be something you do at the start, because like right now, I probably, there's probably a better way of doing it than I've done. But like, I'm just a bit lazy to change the way I'm currently doing. So, I think definitely getting it as early as possible as when you get to UQ would be the best way to go about it. 

Liam: *All right, well, thank you very much for your time today, Jono.* 

Jonathan: 
>That's all right.
