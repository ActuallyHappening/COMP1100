## Firstly, what degree are you styding at UQ, and how did you come to choosing that degree?
I am currently studing a bachelour of advanced business, and I came to studying that upon the knowledge that I would be able to transfer to bachelour of advanced finance and economics with full credit after one year.

## Interesting, so when you chose that degree how did you pick which courses to enroll in?
I spoke to an academic advisor for the bachelour of advaced finance and economics

## And that was an official UQ advisor
Yes, yes

## And did they give you a course planner
Yes they gave me a course planner

## So, did you look up those courses on the UQ website, did you do any other research?
Yes

## So, when you were doing that research, did you write any of that information down, did you write any of that down on like a word document?
Yes, I wrote it down on a piece of paper

## Another interesting question, would you ever consider doing a course without having finished its pre-requisites?
