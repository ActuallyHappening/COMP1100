### Calebâ€™s interview questions (personal use)

Hey \_\_\_\! This interview is recorded, are you OK with that? \[Yes\]

Firstly, what degree are you studying at UQ and how did you come to choosing that degree?
\[...\]

After you had chosen that degree, how did you decide exactly which courses to enroll in?
\[...\]

When you were deciding which courses to enroll in, did you encounter any difficulties with the UQ website? Like, did you end up writing down information about the courses in a separate place for example?
\[...\]

Also, did you rely on the course planner at all?
\[...\]

Would you ever consider doing a course without having first finished its pre-requisites? And have you ever enrolled in a subject without having done its pre-requisites?
\[...\]

Interesting. And finally, when researching which courses you wanted to take, would you benefit from a holistic visualisation? Like a digital tree diagram that links to each course page? Or what would be most beneficial if you could wave a magic wand?
\[...\]

Huh, great\! Hey, thanks \_\_\_ for your time, cya around soon ðŸ™‚
