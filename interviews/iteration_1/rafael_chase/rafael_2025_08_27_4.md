Rafael: So, do you mind if I record you? 

Henry: Yeah, that's fine. 

Rafael: All right. Do you have, like, a strong plan for the courses that you're doing right now? 

Henry: Do I have a strong plan? No, I'm just going through, I guess, year by year and then just talking to people, 'cause, I'll be honest, I haven't fully made up my mind which engineering I'm going with. 

Rafael: Yeah. So, yeah. So, when you do make a decision on that, though, do you think you're still just going to, you, go with the flow? 

Henry: I guess I will. I guess, itâ€™s mainly based on, like, people as well as the online course plan. 

Rafael: Yeah. Okay. Do you use the UQ course planner, or do you just, you know, go by what other people say?

Henry: I go through a mix of it, actually, so, yeah, I use both and see what the courses are, what looks interesting to me, and then off that, I ask people, oh, if I can't make a decision, which course is what I choose? Yeah, right, okay. 

Rafael: So you wouldn't say that you are, you know, very hard like the rigid structure of the course, but that you take it as a guide. 

Henry: Yeah, exactly. If it was like a more seamless and efficient system.

Rafael: Do you think you'd use the course planner  if it was seamless?

Henry: Yeah, I definitely would. 

Rafael: Yeah, okay, awesome. Thank you.
