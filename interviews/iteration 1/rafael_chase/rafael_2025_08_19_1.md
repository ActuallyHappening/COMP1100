Hongkai: I think that's definitely a room for improvement, especially for gathering the information regarding the courses, that could definitely be an improvement as right now, the system is designed, so that you get the information from many different websites. Which makes it a bit. I got it especially with new students. to like, know where to get those resources. 

Rafael: Yeah, so do you think it just takes more time than it should take for a new student? Yeah. Okay. Thank you.
