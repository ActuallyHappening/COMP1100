Liam: *All right, Leon, do you agree to have yourself recorded?* 

Leon: 
>Ah, yes, I do. 

Liam: *Okay so the first question I'd like to ask today is how have you found your process of enrolling into courses so far at the University of Queensland? Any difficulties you might have encountered?* 

Leon: 
>No, it's all been pretty easy. I think all of the course profiles and, like, plans have been really easy to understand, so I know exactly what I need to enrol for, so it's been easy so far. 

Liam: *Yeah, that sounds great. And so do you have any electives that you need to enrol into?* 

Leon: 
>I have so far only had one for my geography course, that I've gotten to choose for, otherwise, everything's been compulsory so far. 

Liam: *How do you make choice on your elective that you are going to do?* 

Leon: 
>I usually read through all the course profiles, see what's sort of most interesting to me. and then also check what might be a prerequisite for things that I might be interested in second or third year, things like that. 

Liam: *Yeah, so, when it comes to enrolling, what procedure do you normally follow to get through like the courses that you want?* 

Leon: 
>procedure as in... 

Liam: *Like what like what process do you go through normally to like, either narrow down to the course that you want or like, just initially make that that selection?* 

Leon: 
>Well, you usually check the page for the degree and then the major that I'm doing to see all the different courses I can pick, then check through, find the ones that I'm like, make a decision on the one I want to do, and then put it into the enrolment portal. 

Liam: *So when you're doing that, how do you make note or track all the prerequisites that you need to find?* 

Leon: 
>I usually just write it down in a separate, like, word document plan that I've got set up. 

Liam: *How do you find that?* 

Leon: 
>Pretty good, but it'd probably be good if there was, like, a more in depth, I think, plan or thing to help, especially like first year students, because they don't really know how to design, like a full course plan. I think that would be probably really useful. 

Liam: *Yeah, and so, um. when it comes to actually enrolling into your courses, have you ever, like accidentally, like, almost, or have you actually made a selection of a course that you've realised in hindsight, you can't take because of a prerequisite or similar?* 

Leon: 
>I haven't yet, but it's definitely something I try to avoid, and it's something I make sure to try and look at before I enrol in anything. 

Liam: *So you make sure to check that beforehand?* 

Leon: 
>Yeah, I try my best to. 

Liam: *Any other remarks youâ€™d like to make on the subject?* 

Leon: 
>Not so much, just. It's been pretty good so far, and I feel like if you're pretty organised and make sure you're thorough with it, I think it's a pretty easy process. 

Liam: *Well, thank you very much, Leon.* 

Leon: 
>Thank you
