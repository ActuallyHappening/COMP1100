**Test Cards:**

We believe that \[target\] are \[showing behaviour / display interest in \] \[for reason Y\]

To verify that, we will \[undertake behaviour\] to \[identify behaviour\]

And measure \[particular variable\]

We are right if \[some measurable statement\]

Therefore, we will ask \[specific questions\]

### Test Cards:

| We believe that students are slowed down during the course enrolment procedure as it split over many sites |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students to identify time loss |
| And measure how long it takes them to choose courses |
| We are right if students are spending over 30 minutes trying to choose courses |
| Therefore, we will ask: Would you find it beneficial to have a more seamless system to apply for courses? How do you find the integration between the numerous websites that UQ uses to display and utilise information regarding courses? |

| We believe that students make erroneous selections in their course planning because prerequisites are not communicated to them. |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students to see if they have ever chosen a course they regret for credit reasons. |
| And measure how many students have had this experience. |
| We are right if over 50% of students have experienced this issue.  |
| Therefore, we will ask: Have you ever had an experience where you have chosen a course that you later regretted for credit reasons? How often are you aware of course prerequisites when you enrol for a course and how much do they play a part in your decision? |

| We believe that students enrol in courses having completed the prerequisites beforehand. |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students to see if they would ever consider doing a course without prerequisites.  |
| And measure how many students would take this option.  |
| We are right if over 51% of students would do the prerequisite beforehand |
| Therefore, we will ask: Would you ever consider doing a course without having first finished its pre-requisites? And have you ever enrolled in a subject without having done its pre-requisites? How important is it to you to do the prerequisites of any class you are doing? |

| We believe that students are often not aware of the selection of courses offered by the university.  |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students with electives on how they choose their subjects.  |
| And measure how many students diversity beyond their degree or want to diversify beyond their degree.  |
| We are right if over 40% of students want to do more than the course that they are enrolled in |
| Therefore, we will ask: How do you choose your electives for your university degree? Would you consider doing a larger selection of courses if you knew what was on offer? |

| We believe that students who keep a plan for the courses they do are forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students about their plans |
| And measure what they used to construct it. |
| We are right if a number of students agree. |
| Therefore, we will ask: Do you have a plan for what courses you are doing? What platform is this plan on, how do you access it? |
