**\*\* It’s okay to stray from the script**

**(closed question):**  
When you were applying for courses for your degree, did you find the process structure to be more difficult than you imagined? \~ something to this effect

Was the process of choosing courses for your degree difficult?

**(open question):**

Tell me about any difficulties you faced in choosing courses to enrol in.

### Liam Bienkowski:

**Closed Question:**  
Liam: Now ,Ben, when you were applying for your course, did you find the process of selecting like the order in which you're going to do your courses to be more difficult than you imagined?

Ben: No, I found it to be what I expected. You find the course codes from your course guides and enter them in. It's all quite straightforward. 

Liam: And how about prerequisites; were prerequisites more difficult than you imagined, trying to work around them? 

Ben: In terms of meeting them, no, at least for the first year, it was fine for me. It'd make a more difficult later, I don't know, but the release clearly stated, so I'd say no, it was not difficult. 

Liam: Yeah, and just coming back to that, would you say that, like, the process of navigating all the sites was more difficult than you imagined, or was it easier than you thought it was going to be coming into uni to find all your details? 

Ben: I'd say probably a bit difficult, manly because my SI-Net are the layout of that compared to the course guides on the public website is very different and very jarring. But once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad as long as you know where to look.   
Liam: Thank you very much.

**Open Question:**  
Liam: So, Matthew, tell me about any difficulties that you might have had when doing like to the course planning for your degree. 

Matthew: Um, figuring out which course is to do and which semester and like, some course are in the offered one semester a year or sometimes even one every second year to figuring out when to do what. 

Liam: Yeah, just like come into like also like figuring out your prerequisites and stuff like that for those courses? 

Matthew: Yes, exactly, yeah. That's also, yeah, that's important, yes. 

Liam: Yeah, and it's like, how difficult would you say that was going through, especially at the end of last year, figuring out how to enrol in your courses this year? 

Matthew: Well, I haven't exactly fully you got a plan yet, because I don't exactly know course me do, so I still in the process, but I think not too difficult once you actually know what you want to do, but when you have to balance the two together, it's a part of. 

Liam: Okay. Thanks.

### Rafael Chase:

**Open question:**  
**Rafael**: Okay Ruby, tell me about any difficulties you encountered when you were planning for your degree.

**Ruby**: For my honours programme I have to do so many courses at level three which has meant that for some of my general electives that aren’t relating to my major. I want to do more courses that are at level two, but unfortunately I have to account for the credits I have to fulfill in order to get my honours mark. I have to do so many certain ones at level three where else I think some of them at level two would actually benefit me more so I’ve been trying to be very discerning in how I actually choose and do my course planning. For the small amount of level two courses I can take and the large amount of level three ones I have to take when it comes to these general electives. 

**Rafael**: So, would you say that the course planner for your degree lacks a certain nuance as to how it should actually work?

**Ruby:** I don’t know if I would say that because I understand that there are certain level three requirements that need to be fulfilled, but maybe there should be more structure when it comes to the general electives within the programme, and how one might structure that if they wanted to focus more on economics and philosophy or politics as opposed to their major.

**Rafael:** Would you say that you’ve had any difficulties with course requirements in particular?

**Ruby:** No.

**Rafael:** Not at all?

**Ruby:** No.

**Rafael:** Okay, thank you for your time.

**Ruby:** No worries.

**Closed question:**  
**Rafael:** Okay Liam, when you were applying for your degree, did you find the process to be more difficult than you imagined?

**Liam:** Well I’m going to be completely honest Raf, I did. I switched to my bachelor of science quite literally this semester and wanted to do an extended psychology course and there was a lot of confusion over which science courses I should do. In comparison to what I've done in high school and then what order I should do them so not gonna lie that did have me a little but my law not so much. 

**Rafael:** Did you have a problem with the course plan that they provided?

**Liam:** That’s a question.

**Rafael:** Did you know it existed?

**Liam:** No. I needed one for my other degree, but when I switched I didn’t realise they would give me another plan.

**Rafael:** Yeah, okay yeah no that’s okay thank you. Is there anything else you’d like to add specifically maybe? Was it a more annoying process or like a difficult process? How do you think it could be better?

**Liam:** Well for starters showing that course planner more clear. I think that would be helpful but I’m not sure if it could be better.

**Rafael:** Okay thank you.

### Patrick Elgey:

Open question:  
**Patrick**: Tell me about any difficulties you have faced in choosing courses to enrol in.

**Charlotte**: Oh ok- I think the most difficult things involving my courses were the fact that there were so many options I had to choose between. I had to carefully pick a selection of courses that would not overwhelm me and yet meet the requirements for my course or major. It was quite stressful for me because unlike other degrees, which only had a limited list of courses to choose from, I had to somehow pick only several out of a few hundred \- because the bachelor of science is one of the largest courses at UQ

Closed question:  
**Patrick**: Was the process of choosing courses for your degree difficult?

**Amelia**: Yeah, I did have some difficulty in choosing the correct courses during both semesters this year. I have been working towards a mechatronics specialization for my vertical engineering degree, and with the limited elective slots, I have been trying to complete mandatory courses this year. Last semester was pretty straight-forward with the information I found on the UQ website , that being 3 engineering introductory courses and math \- but I would have really appreciated some extra information about the differences between MATH1071 or MATH1051. The only difference I spotted at the time was that 1071 had "Advanced" out the front of the name. Even though I did well in 1071 last semester, I slightly regret my choice. I picked 1071 from the name and with minimal information about the course's structure. It would have been quite helpful to learn about how to navigate the past ECPs and degree outlines earlier. For this semester, it was a lot easier but I still had a difficult time with course selection even after speaking to the Academic advisors about it. The co-requisites and pre-requisites for a course limited my choices of mandatory subjects which lead me to use up an elective slot which I have been trying to save for future.

# Week 3 Meeting:

Length: Is one longer than the other on average?

Context: Which response gave you more context or background?

Comfort: Did the interviewee seem more comfortable or willing to elaborate in response to one type of question?

Perspective: Which question helped you understand the interviewee’s perspective better?

Clarify: Did either question lead to a clearer understanding of the challenge?

Future practice: Based on this experience, how might you change your interview questions in future?

Write a brief report answering the above (

**Length**: Closed was shorter, but was not significant and found variations were larger between students

**Context**: 

- Balanced, different perspectives for questions  
- Both questions were effective in providing necessary context

**Comfort**: 

- Both questions, open invited them more so

**Perspective:**

- Interviewees provided perspective before answering both  
- Open gave them opportunity for slightly more

**Clarify:** 

- Closed question allowed us to get clarity on the actual subject matter  
- Open question allowed for subject-matter adjacent items

**Future Practise:**

- Both questions were very important and did provide useful information regarding the challenge. However, the findings support that the interviewee was more important than the question itself. (this may be due to the vast scope of the question)

## Report (to be submitted 24h after team notification)

### Liam B Report:

**Length**:   
The difference in length between responses was minimal when comparing data from the closed- and open-ended questions. Whilst the argument could be made that responses to the open-ended questions were slightly longer, data was mixed from across the group. The findings supported the conclusion that variations between students’ personalities was the largest contributing factor to response length rather than style of question. 

**Context**:   
Both styles of question provided adequate context. While the closed- and open-ended questions did provide different perspectives from the respondents, both styles of question were effective in providing the context necessary to understand their position on the matter. Even for the closed-ended questions, students were giving their context on a matter unprompted, only resorting to simple yes/no answers when follow-up closed questions were asked to reaffirm or counter their position. However, by this stage the necessary context had most likely already been gained. 

**Comfort**:   
The respondents felt comfortable answering both styles of question. The open-ended question did allow participants more freedom to elaborate or expand their answers, and this was demonstrated. However, both sets of questions allowed students to feel comfortable answering. This could be seen because the necessary interviewing procedure was followed before asking questions. Namely, interviewers asked interviewees on whether they were comfortable answering questions about the subject on-record. This allowed the respondent to affirm their commitment to be interviewed, or back out if they so wished. Therefore, all students being interviewed wished to be so before they were asked any questions on-record. 

**Perspective:**  
Perspective can be seen to tie in greatly into the point around context. The respondents perspective is often informed by their context, and this was evident through the answers received. When questioning participants in both the open and closed question sets, they often would provide an explanation on where they stood before answering. This could have been information regarding their degree, how many years they had been at UQ or other extenuating circumstances they deemed may have been relevant to answering the question. This is consistent about the point about context. It was noted that asking follow-up questions in both sets of questions did allow for further explanation of stances or previous experiences that shaped how the interviewee sees the problem today. As these questions tended towards being more open-ended, an argument could be made that, while closed questions do allow for perspective, open-ended questions permit this to a greater extent. 

**Clarity:**   
Both closed- and open-ended questions allowed for further clarity from the interviewee. Closed questions tended to provide greater clarity on the relevant subject matter. As this style of question often focuses on quizzing the respondent on a particular set of circumstances, asking further questions in this vein allowed them to clarify and rehash matter that they had brought up to affirm their opinion on the problem discussed. Therefore, this permits the interviewer, upon revision of the interview, to better understand the perspectives given to them and make better-informed decisions on a particular issue. The open-ended questions provided different results. Namely, the clarification offered by interviewees would often be subject-matter adjacent. In practice, this meant that the conversation was able to flow to different areas that had not been considered by the interviewing team as being a problem. This allowed the interviewer to gain a greater understanding of the problems that exist within the broader challenge being faced. In turn, this permits the team to refine or redirect the solution being developed to attack the best or most relevant problem, rather than the initial problem identified. 

**Future Practise:**  
In conclusion, both questions proved useful to understanding the target audience and provided useful information. The findings suggest that both closed and open questions can be useful in an interview setting to get the best set of information from the interviewee, when done right. However, one unexpected finding was that the type of person being interviewed mattered as much as the question being asked. Namely, a good question being asked to someone who is naturally willing to talk and elaborate is much more likely to yield results than a great question asked to someone who is naturally more reserved and less talkative. 

# Week 4 Meeting:

Chosen challenge:

### **Selecting courses**

Once enrolled in a program, students receive a course plan. However, still many choices remain: can I switch do core courses in a different order to the plan? Which electives should I take? Which major and courses should I take for specific career paths?

**Challenge:** The challenge is to innovate a software-based solution to help students to navigate selection of majors, courses, etc., throughout various stages of their degree program.

Hypotheses:

- It is harder than it needs to be to pick courses while maintaining prerequisites

Value propositions

- Students wish for an easier way to find prerequisites  
- Students find the current course selection system convoluted  
- Students wish to find a course that will help them diverse their carrier paths  
- Students find that needing to choose courses in a specific order is important to their time at UQ

Customer relations

- Students wish to have a more integrated solution (rather than 3+ programs to view information: [MySI.net](http://MySI.net), allocate+, etc.)  
- Students want to have more options for class allocation and timetable during the semester 

Channels

- Students are forced to use alternative programs to cobble together course plans  
- Word of mouth, spreading through 

Customer segments

- Our customers are comprised of students

Interview questions:

- Would you find it beneficial to have a more seamless system to apply for courses?  
- In your experience, has the course application process been a seamless system, is there any room for tangible improvement?  
- In your experience at UQ, how important is it to you to be able to effectively view and choose your courses based on prerequisites?  
- What problems have you encountered when planning your courses? (focus follow-up)  
- How do you find the integration between the numerous websites that UQ uses to display and utilise information regarding courses?  
- Are

**Test Cards:**

We believe that \[target\] are \[showing behaviour / display interest in \] \[for reason Y\]

To verify that, we will \[undertake behaviour\] to \[identify behaviour\]

And measure \[particular variable\]

We are right if \[some measurable statement\]

Therefore, we will ask \[specific questions\]

### Test Cards:

| We believe that students are slowed down during the course enrolment procedure as it split over many sites |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students to identify time loss |
| And measure how long it takes them to choose courses |
| We are right if students are spending over 30 minutes trying to choose courses |
| Therefore, we will ask: Would you find it beneficial to have a more seamless system to apply for courses? How do you find the integration between the numerous websites that UQ uses to display and utilise information regarding courses? |

| We believe that students make erroneous selections in their course planning because prerequisites are not communicated to them. |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students to see if they have ever chosen a course they regret for credit reasons. |
| And measure how many students have had this experience. |
| We are right if over 50% of students have experienced this issue.  |
| Therefore, we will ask: Have you ever had an experience where you have chosen a course that you later regretted for credit reasons? How often are you aware of course prerequisites when you enrol for a course and how much do they play a part in your decision? |

| We believe that students enrol in courses having completed the prerequisites beforehand. |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students to see if they would ever consider doing a course without prerequisites.  |
| And measure how many students would take this option.  |
| We are right if over 51% of students would do the prerequisite beforehand |
| Therefore, we will ask: Would you ever consider doing a course without having first finished its pre-requisites? And have you ever enrolled in a subject without having done its pre-requisites? How important is it to you to do the prerequisites of any class you are doing? |

| We believe that students are often not aware of the selection of courses offered by the university.  |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students with electives on how they choose their subjects.  |
| And measure how many students diversity beyond their degree or want to diversify beyond their degree.  |
| We are right if over 40% of students want to do more than the course that they are enrolled in |
| Therefore, we will ask: How do you choose your electives for your university degree? Would you consider doing a larger selection of courses if you knew what was on offer? |

| We believe that students who keep a plan for the courses they do are forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it |
| :---- |
| To verify that, we will interview students about their plans |
| And measure what they used to construct it. |
| We are right if a number of students agree. |
| Therefore, we will ask: Do you have a plan for what courses you are doing? What platform is this plan on, how do you access it? |

### Caleb’s interview questions (personal use)

Hey \_\_\_\! This interview is recorded, are you OK with that? \[Yes\]

Firstly, what degree are you studying at UQ and how did you come to choosing that degree?  
\[...\]

After you had chosen that degree, how did you decide exactly which courses to enroll in?  
\[...\]

When you were deciding which courses to enroll in, did you encounter any difficulties with the UQ website? Like, did you end up writing down information about the courses in a separate place for example?  
\[...\]

Also, did you rely on the course planner at all?  
\[...\]

Would you ever consider doing a course without having first finished its pre-requisites? And have you ever enrolled in a subject without having done its pre-requisites?  
\[...\]

Interesting. And finally, when researching which courses you wanted to take, would you benefit from a holistic visualisation? Like a digital tree diagram that links to each course page? Or what would be most beneficial if you could wave a magic wand?  
\[...\]

Huh, great\! Hey, thanks \_\_\_ for your time, cya around soon 🙂

Misc: features i would personally enjoy in this product:

- Identifying whether a course will occur in a semester based on previous offerings  
-
