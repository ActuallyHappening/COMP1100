# Week 4 Meeting:

## Agenda
- Choose challenge
- Discuss hypotheses to be used in the business model canvas

Chosen challenge:

### **Selecting courses**

Once enrolled in a program, students receive a course plan. However, still many choices remain: can I switch do core courses in a different order to the plan? Which electives should I take? Which major and courses should I take for specific career paths?

**Challenge:** The challenge is to innovate a software-based solution to help students to navigate selection of majors, courses, etc., throughout various stages of their degree program.

Hypotheses:

- It is harder than it needs to be to pick courses while maintaining prerequisites

Value propositions

- Students wish for an easier way to find prerequisites
- Students find the current course selection system convoluted
- Students wish to find a course that will help them diverse their carrier paths
- Students find that needing to choose courses in a specific order is important to their time at UQ

Customer relations

- Students wish to have a more integrated solution (rather than 3+ programs to view information: [MySI.net](http://MySI.net), allocate+, etc.)
- Students want to have more options for class allocation and timetable during the semester

Channels

- Students are forced to use alternative programs to cobble together course plans
- Word of mouth, spreading through

Customer segments

- Our customers are comprised of students
