Our project UQ Plan It aims to solve current UI issues, so that UI will be easy to use and navigate and fast for undergraduate UQ Students who are planning which courses to enroll in during their course. We believe that our unique value proposition is the ability to have multi-user engagement features. The following competitor analysis includes a comparison table, SWOT analysis of key competitors, and strategic insights based on our findings
# Analysis

## COMPARISON TABLE

| Competitor | Direct/Indirect | Target | Key Features | Strengths | Weaknesses | Other Notes |
|------------|-----------------|--------|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Student VIP | Indirect | students | marketplace, textbooks, notes | Network, large active user base | focus is on commerce, not on academic | Solution is not well known and its features are not as built out as they could be |
| UQ My Course Planner | Direct | students | validation | authoritative | inflexible | as it is found in a PDF form for most students, it does provide a very good way of viewing courses but falls down due to the inability to manipulate it |
| Uni of Melb My Course Planner | Direct | students (uni-specific) | official, accurate | inflexible, isolated | Uni of Melb course planner is most similar to the solution that we propose, but comments from other users regarding courses cannot be viewed |
| EdStem Discussion Boards | Indirect | classmates | Q&A | Immediate | disorganized | [interviews](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-20_3.md) attest that the edstem board can get cluttered and full of unnesecary informatation very quickly. |
| Campusvue | Direct | students | scheduling | combines schedule, tasks, grade in one personal view | not tailored to specific uni degree prerequisites | can provide a good base model, but as it tries to tailor to many different prerequisites it can be restricted by its own success |
| UQ Plan It | Direct | students | unified student profile,visual progress tracker,multi-scenario planning | adaptable,efficient | Data dependent, university reliance, moderation need| Overall, seeks to condense many of the above website's core functions into one coherent solution.|

## SWOT Analysis

### UQ My course planner 
Strength: *It is the Official university website and authority,accurate, institution-approved data and mandatory use for degree planning.*

Weaknesses: *Inflexible planning capabilities, poor user experience and interface design, limited to single-path planning.*

Opportunities: *User experience improvements could dominate market,integration with other university systems and expansion to include community features.*

Threats: *Students preference for better-designed unofficial tools, pressure to improve from competing platforms and Limited innovation capacity.*

### CampusVue  
Strength: *Strong personal organization and scheduling, comprehensive task and grade tracking and good semester-level planning.*

Weaknesses: *Generic approach not tailored to specific degrees, limited long-term degree planning capabilities and Weak on prerequisites tracking.*

Opportunities: *Deeper integration with university degree requirements,expansion into long-term planning features and specialization for specific academic programs.*

Threats: *Features becoming standard in other student apps, competition from specialized degree planners and limited differentiation in crowded market.*

# Insights and Strategy
| Insights | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| Official university tools are accurate but frustrating to use - students see them as a chore rather than a help. | Focus on creating an experience that feels effortless and even enjoyable. A smooth, intuitive design will be our biggest advantage. |
| Students currently juggle multiple disconnected tools - a planner here, discussion boards there, review sites elsewhere. Nothing ties everything together. | Position ourselves as the one-stop solution that brings all these needs together in a cohesive, simple way that reduces complexity. |
| No existing tool helps students answer their biggest "what if" questions about changing majors or exploring different paths through their degree. | Make our flexible scenario planner the heart of what we offer - it's not just a feature, but our core value proposition for helping students feel empowered. |
| Our most valuable features (like student reviews) depend on having an active community. An empty platform won't help anyone. | Our initial focus needs to be on building community momentum - seeding content, encouraging early adopters, and making sure the first users feel their contributions matter. |
| Some competitors have large student audiences but don't address academic planning needs, leaving a gap we can fill. | Explore ways to reach these existing audiences by solving a problem they experience but isn't being addressed by platforms they already use. |

## Conclusion
Overall, walking through the different competitors, it is clear that our solution seeks to improve on each of them in different aspects. The main issue that we have found from interviewees is the presence of the numerous different existing services (as exhibited above) is a burden onto students when trying to complete a course. Therefore, our solution seeks to consolidate the major aspects of these services into one piece of software. Whilst aspects such as timetabling of individual classes in a semester fall outside the scope of the MVP and so will still require a separate website, key elements such as gathering, viewing, choosing and ordering courses (which can occur on as many as 4 different pieces of software today) can be consolidated down into one piece of software. A model similar to that of the University of Melbourne could be pursued. However, to differentiate ourselves from their solution to stand out in the market, the implementation of the user engagement features (friends, comments) would be included in the solution.
