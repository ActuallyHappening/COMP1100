# Business Model Canvas
## Iteration 1 (Updated in Iteration 2 & 3):
**Customer Segments**
1) We believe that our customers are undergraduate students who need to select courses every semester.

This hypothesis was accepted. The amount of feedback recieved in interviews demonstrate a demand from undergraduate students for a solution in this field to be developed. As shown in the evaluation of hypotheses in the [value proposition canvas](value_proposition_canvas.md), many of the assumed pains and gains of this customer base were proven to be correct. Therefore, there is clear need to address this customer segment with a solution in the area that we are proposing.  

2) We believe students invest more time than they would like in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites. [Iteration 1 Test Card 1](test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 1 Learning Card 1](../iteration_1/learning_cards.md).

3) We believe that students make erroneous selections during course planning as a consequence of a lack of proper communication as prerequisites are not properly communicated. [Iteration 1 Test Card 2](../iteration_1/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was discarded for reasons found in [Iteration 1 Learning Card 2](../iteration_1/learning_cards.md).

4) We believe students enrol in courses having already completed the appropriate prerequisites. [Iteration 1 Test Card 3](../iteration_1/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 1 Learning Card 3](../iteration_1/learning_cards.md).

5) We believe students are unaware of the selection of courses offered by the university. [Iteration 1 Test Card 4](../iteration_1/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was discarded for reasons found in [Iteration 1 Learning Card 4](../iteration_1/learning_cards.md).

6) We believe students who keep a plan for the courses they do are forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it. [Iteration 1 Test Card 5](../iteration_1/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 1 Learning Card 5](../iteration_1/learning_cards.md).

7) We believe students plan their course in reference to a long-term course plan [Iteration 2 Test Card 2](../iteration_2/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was rejected for reasons found in [Iteration 2 Learning Card 2](../iteration_2/learning_cards.md).

**Value Propositions**
1) We believe that our market wants an easier way to identify the prerequisites for a given course

This hypothesis was accepted as many interviewees reported struggling to find information such as prerequisites, often having to open needlessly many browser tabs.

Evidence
- "Oh, um for me, for my degree, it's pretty straightforward, because there's not too many prerequisites. But, like, the course profiles are a bit annoying to go through and like, have to look individually each course to find all the prerequisites for it. But, like, I know how to do it. It's like it's very well, like very commonly known. Yeah." - [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 1 Interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-20_2.md)
- "First off, I'd like if it could have maybe an easier way to see when the classes run and what the prereqs are. And then another thing, when I was doing the dual degree, there was stuff where it's like, 'if you take this course and you're doing this major, then it counts towards the math degree." - [Patrick Elgey Iteration 1 Interview 6](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_09_01_6.md)

2) We believe that our market wants a less convoluted process to select and enroll in courses

This hypothesis was discarded as it was found through interviews that the problem with selecting courses and not with the enrolling process, but the choosing of what courses to enrol in. Moreover, this was found to be more annoying than convoluted. This process is the one that is convoluted, whereas actually enrolling is straightforward.

Evidence
- "Yes, the UI and experience throughout that process is terrible, yeah plenty of notetaking" - [Caleb Yates Iteration 1 Interview 4](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_8_22_4.md)
- "I think the website can be a bit frustrating when trying to find what course prerequisites are but other than that and on the study planner for mathematics computer science there is this just blank spot where it doesn't say anything in the course and that's a bit annoying but other than that, it's not too bad." [Rafael Chase iteration 1 Interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/rafael_chase/rafael_2025_08_28_7.md)

3) We believe that our market wants the ability to plan course completion order for their degree

This hypothesis is accepted based on many interviewees who reported that the ability to plan completion order would be quite helpful, especially by the way of prerequisites. 

Evidence
- "I usually just write it down in a separate, like, word document plan that I've got set up." - [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 1 Interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-27_7.md)
- "I mostly have put it down onto a simple document, a plan for each of my semesters" - [Patrick Elgey Iteration 1 Interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_08_25_2.md)

4) We believe students would like a forum to interact with other people who have completed courses they have already completed [Iteration 2 Test Card 3](../iteration_2/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 2 Learning Card 3](../iteration_2/learning_cards.md).

## Iteration 2:
**Channels**
1) We believe that our customers would like to have a laptop-capable website to view, edit and choose courses in line with the solution proposed

This hypothesis was accepted based on the responses that a laptop-based solution would provide the best medium to display data and provide the best usability for the solution trying to be achieved. 

Evidence:
- "Because I think you can get more functionality out of a laptops, laptop capable website." - [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-20_3.md)

2) We believe that our customers would like to have a phone app to view their course information and compare with friends on-the-go.

This hypothesis was rejected because of the responses that stated that a purely-phone app would not appropiately suit the needs trying to be addressed. Whilst they suggested that a phone companion app may be useful, a purely phone application was inappropiate for the solution being developed. 

Evidence:
- "Um, I would be okay if it was both for a hybrid system, I would not be okay if it was exclusively a mobile app." - [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-20_3.md)

**Customer Relationships**
1) We believe that customers will spread the news about this through word of mouth

This hypothesis was accepted as the interview responses suggested that news of this would permeate throughout the campus. However, responses stated that they would not like to be their only medium of finding out, as often people would set up their course plans on an alternative platform before finding out that this software existed.

Evidence:
- "So then it becomes a problem later when someone tells you word of mouth. Like, oh, use this thing, because you're like, it's a bit late now, right? Like, I've already done some of it or I don't want to start. I don't want to change the way I'm currently doing it, right?" - [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-18_2.md)

2) We believe that customers would like UQ to promote this through the 'Welcome to UQ' page for new students

This hypothesis was accepted as the interview responses suggested that learning about this at the beginning of their UQ experience would make the entry into UQ a lot smoother than it currently is. Furthermore, it would build up a good habit in having course plans prepared. 

Evidence:
- "Um, I think it should definitely be promoted by UQ... like when you're like, um, like, yeah, Welcome to UQ" - [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-18_2.md)

3) We believe students wish to take the same courses as their friends where possible [Iteration 2 Test Card 1](../iteration_2/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 2 Learning Card 1](../iteration_2/learning_cards.md).

4) We believe students donâ€™t understand how their major affects how credit points are counted towards their degree [Iteration 2 Test Card 4](../iteration_2/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 2 Learning Card 4](../iteration_2/learning_cards.md).

## Iteration 3:

Assume all other channels, customer relationships etc from iterations one & two

1) We believe students find it more seamless now that there exists only one central tab to select courses [Test Card 1](../iteration_3/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 3 Learning Card 1](../iteration_3/learning_cards.md)

Our potential customers were thrilled at the prospect of one-tab course planning, as this provides a more seamles and intuitive system to effectively plan for future years. We also found that our potential customers were genuinely disappointed in the current methods of course planning. Whilst it doesn't necessarily move some customers as compared to others, it was unanimously agreed that one-tab is a more effective, and efficient method of course planning. 

2) We believe students will find it easier to obtain course information such as prerequisites and incompatibilities when selecting courses [Test Card 2](../iteration_3/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 3 Learning Card 2](../iteration_3/learning_cards.md)

As well, students we interviewed agreed that most of the tabs they have open in course planning is to first keep track of which courses they are considering, but also in an attempt to locate the relavent information for a course. This includes, but is not limited to: course prerequisites, incompatibilities, which semesters a course is offered, etc. 

3) We believe students will spend less time selecting courses now that the system is centralised. [Test Card 3](../iteration_3/test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 3 learning card 3](../iteration_3/learning_cards.md)

Our potential customers likewise agreed that the current system is more time consuming than strictly necessary. Many students do not want to spend a lot of time in course planning, and so typically leave it to the last minute. Our more modular, seamless and integrated design allows for quick course planning by providing all relavent courses in one place, and allowing to modify and customise their plan as opposed to the static course planner. 

4) We believe students will use our solution over their current methods of course selection. [Test Card 4](../iteration_3/test_cards.md)

this hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Iteration 3 Learning Card 4](../iteration_3/learning_cards.md)

This was found to be a unanimously agreed upon prospect by our future potential customers. Reasons for this change to be made were cited mainly as previous pains as explained by the previous test / learning cards. This was highly informative, as students essentially revealed that the more simple, and well-integrated system is far more effective and usable than the current system. As such, our product has value to the students of UQ.
