### Hypothesis one: We hypothesise students find it more seamless now that there exists one central tab to select courses

*Test:* To test this, we will interview students to see if they believe our new system is more efficient.

*Metric:* We will measure the response provided by students as to their preferential system

*Observations:* On the whole, students find that the current system results in far too many tabs open at a time, and overall agree that it is an unintuitive system. It was also observated that, following a demo of our MVP, students agreed that UQ planit's one tab solution to course planning would be a far more effective way to plan, and select courses. 

*Learning and Insights:* We learned that students are strongly dissatisfied with the current system of planning, especiaily for first years. We also learned that students would by far prefer our current system given the proof of concept, should it be widely implemented. 

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis.

### Hypothesis two: We believe students will find it easier to obtain course information such as prerequisites and incompatibilities when selecting courses

*Test:* To test this we will interview students with our MVP to see if they find the new solution to have more accessible vital course information. 

*Metric:* We will measure if students prefer to have a system where all relevant course information for planning is preferred.

*Observations:* Students believe that having a centralised and consolidated course planning, like the one provided in UQ planit, will aid them in choosing the correct, and preferable courses as opposed to arbitrary and ill informed decisions. This is a result of students now having all required information provided on the one website, with a singular page, and the option to read more indepth about specific courses with a simple redirection. 

*Learning and Insights:* We learned that students current find it difficult, and overwhelming to plan ahead, as they are too bogged down on focusing on what courses they have to choose for the time being. This also pertains to a lack of clear direction and pointers to relavent and necessary information for course planning. 

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis.

### Hypothesis three: We believe students will spend less time selecting courses now that the system is centralised.

*Test:* To test this, we will interview students to gather information as to whether or not the new system will reduce time spent on course selections. 

*Metric:* We will measure if a majority of students believe our solution will reduce time on course selections. 

*Observations:* We observed students were struggling to find the time to allocate towards cours planning, as the current system is lacking in proper direction. As such, students aren't willing to plan due to the system being far too time consuming than feels necessary. Students did agree that the UQ plan it solution would greatly reduce time spent on course planning as it provides all necesary information in one place, and an option to effectively plan, and move around courses for dynamic and streamlined planning. 

*Learning and Insights:* We learned students genuienly struggle from this process, and gained an important insight into our own usability in that it is a far more effective *visual* tool for physically seeing what a plan might look like. 

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis.

### Hypothesis four: We believe students will use our solution over their current methods of course selection.

*Test:* To test this, we will interview students to see whether or not students will actually use our solution over the current methods of course selection.

*Metric:* We will measure if most students believe this system is superior, and will therefore use it in future semesters.

*Observations:* When prompted, we observed students unanimously agreed that they would use our system, should it be available, over the current system of course planning. 

*Learning and Insights:* This series of questions revealed students hold the current system with a strong sense of disdain, and wish for something better. As such, they were happy to inform us our solution of UQ plan it would be an effective solution, and a usable one. 

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis.
