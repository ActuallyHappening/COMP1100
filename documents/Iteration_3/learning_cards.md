### Hypothesis one: We hypothesise students find it more seamless now that there exists one central tab to select courses

*Test:* To test this, we will interview students to see if they believe our new system is more efficient.

*Metric:* We will measure the response provided by students as to their preferential system

*Observations:* On the whole, students find that the current system results in far too many tabs open at a time, and overall agree that it is an unintuitive system. It was also observated that, following a demo of our MVP, students agreed that UQ planit's one tab solution to course planning would be a far more effective way to plan, and select courses. 

*Learning and Insights:* We learned that students are strongly dissatisfied with the current system of planning, especiaily for first years. We also learned that students would by far prefer our current system given the proof of concept, should it be widely implemented. 

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis. 

Evidence:
- "Yeah, I just I like it. It's just all there. Like, again, biggest issue is, you got to find a course planner. Yeah. Then you got to go put your courses in. You gotta have your own planner to figure out what you're doing past the first semester, two semesters a year. Like, if you could trying to play in year two, year three, year four, on top, you don't you don't get to. Whereas this makes it easier and yeah, I think that's. I think that's a great tool." - [Rafael Chase, interview 1, iteration 3](../../interviews/iteration_3/rafael_chase/rafael_chase_2025-10-27_1.md)

- "Yeah, 100%. I think it just addresses like basically all the concern I had. Like, 1st of all, it's all in one place, which is helpful." - [Liam Bienkowski, interview 1, iteration 3](../../interviews/iteration_3/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-10-20_1.md)

### Hypothesis two: We believe students will find it easier to obtain course information such as prerequisites and incompatibilities when selecting courses

*Test:* To test this we will interview students with our MVP to see if they find the new solution to have more accessible vital course information. 

*Metric:* We will measure if students prefer to have a system where all relevant course information for planning is preferred.

*Observations:* Students believe that having a centralised and consolidated course planning, like the one provided in UQ planit, will aid them in choosing the correct, and preferable courses as opposed to arbitrary and ill informed decisions. This is a result of students now having all required information provided on the one website, with a singular page, and the option to read more indepth about specific courses with a simple redirection. 

*Learning and Insights:* We learned that students current find it difficult, and overwhelming to plan ahead, as they are too bogged down on focusing on what courses they have to choose for the time being. This also pertains to a lack of clear direction and pointers to relavent and necessary information for course planning. 

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis.

Evidence:
- "You can see prerequisites, compatibility, in the same place where you actually apply for the courses, right? And you can set out your whole plan and everything. And then I think on top of that as well, it shows you core, breadth, like program electives, general electives, all of that." - [Liam Bienkowski, interview 1, iteration 3](../../interviews/iteration_3/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-10-20_1.md)

- "Yeah, I just I like it. It's just all there." - [Rafael Chase, interview 1, iteration 3](../../interviews/iteration_3/rafael_chase/rafael_chase_2025-10-27_1.md)

### Hypothesis three: We believe students will spend less time selecting courses now that the system is centralised.

*Test:* To test this, we will interview students to gather information as to whether or not the new system will reduce time spent on course selections. 

*Metric:* We will measure if a majority of students believe our solution will reduce time on course selections. 

*Observations:* We observed students were struggling to find the time to allocate towards cours planning, as the current system is lacking in proper direction. As such, students aren't willing to plan due to the system being far too time consuming than feels necessary. Students did agree that the UQ plan it solution would greatly reduce time spent on course planning as it provides all necesary information in one place, and an option to effectively plan, and move around courses for dynamic and streamlined planning. 

*Learning and Insights:* We learned students genuienly struggle from this process, and gained an important insight into our own usability in that it is a far more effective *visual* tool for physically seeing what a plan might look like. 

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis.

Evidence:
- "So I think it takes me longer than it should. But me personally, I try and get it done in the least amount of effort as possible. So, like this sort of program would make that a lot easier. And definitely help me out quite a bit." - [Liam Bienkowski, interview 1, iteration 3](../../interviews/iteration_3/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-10-20_1.md)

- "Again, it takes the whole issue of going through the big list of courses being like, oh, is this fun, the one I'm digging over, is it this? Or like, and then having them all the through, whereas, you know, abbreviated just to make sure you put in the right person, but also, like, the link, the proper link to the actual subject itself, on my, really weirdly hard to find. It's not made to just be something quick to do. It's like, oh, it's a whole activity. You gotta go through it. Okay. So, yeah, 100%. That's great." - [Rafael Chase, interview 1, iteration 3](../../interviews/iteration_3/rafael_chase/rafael_chase_2025-10-27_1.md)

### Hypothesis four: We believe students will use our solution over their current methods of course selection.

*Test:* To test this, we will interview students to see whether or not students will actually use our solution over the current methods of course selection.

*Metric:* We will measure if most students believe this system is superior, and will therefore use it in future semesters.

*Observations:* When prompted, we observed students unanimously agreed that they would use our system, should it be available, over the current system of course planning. 

*Learning and Insights:* This series of questions revealed students hold the current system with a strong sense of disdain, and wish for something better. As such, they were happy to inform us our solution of UQ plan it would be an effective solution, and a usable one. 

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis.

Evidence:
- "Oh, yeah. Easily. I barely know what I'm doing in year two, year three, year four, so, I mean, it'd be good" [Rafael Chase, interview 1, iteration 3](../../interviews/iteration_3/rafael_chase/rafael_chase_2025-10-27_1.md)
