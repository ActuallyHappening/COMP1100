### Test Card 1:
**Hypothesis**: We hypothesise students find it more seamless now that there exists only one central tab to select courses

**Test**: To test this, we will interview students to see if they believe our new system is more efficient. 

**Metric**: We will measure the response provided by students as to their preferential system

**Criteria**: If we are correct, over half of interviewed students will agree that the UQ Plan It system is more efficient. 

Therefore, we will ask:
1) What about the current system is so sluggish?
2) Do you believe our solution is more effective than the current system?
3) Do you prefer the system of singular tab course selections? If so, why?

### Test Card 2:
**Hypothesis**: We believe students will find it easier to obtain course information such as prerequisites and incompatibilities when selecting courses

**Test**: To test this we will interview students with our MVP to see if they find the new solution to have more accessible vital course information. 

**Metric**: We will measure if students prefer to have a system where all relevant course information for planning is preferred.

**Criteria**: If we are correct, over half of the interviewed students will prefer having a central, solitary tab for course selections.

Therefore, we will ask:
1) Is the one-tab system more effective than having several open at once?
2) Do you prefer having one tab? If so, why?
3) Do you personally see any benefits in having several tabs open for each course?
4) What do you find beneficial about having only one tab open at a time?

### Test Card 3:
**Hypothesis**: We believe students will spend less time selecting courses now that the system is centralised.

**Test**: To test this, we will interview students to gather information as to whether or not the new system will reduce time spent on course selections. 

**Metric**: We will measure if a majority of students believe our solution will reduce time on course selections. 

**Criteria**: If we are correct, then a majority of the students interviewed will agree with the idea that course selections will be a less time consuming system. 

Therefore, we will ask:
1) How much time do you currently spend on course selections?
2) Do you think this new system will significantly reduce that time?
3) At the very least, do you believe this system will reduce the hassle of the current system?
4) Which factor do you believe saves you the most time?

### Test Card 4:
**Hypothesis**: We believe students will use our solution over their current methods of course selection.

**Test**: To test this, we will interview students to see whether or not students will actually use our solution over the current methods of course selection.

**Metric**: We will measure if most students believe this system is superior, and will therefore use it in future semesters.

**Criteria**: If we are correct, then most students will opt to use our solution over the previous status quo. 

Therefore, we will ask:
1) If our system were to be available, would you use it over whichever method you currently practise?
2) What about our solution do you find better than what you do now?
3) Is there anything in particular that you think could be better, or that your personal method does better?
4) On the whole, what are the strengths that would influence the shift?
