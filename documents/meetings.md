# Week 2 Meeting:

- Challenge chosen: selecting course requirements
- Discussed:
  - Questions to be chosen to be asked (1 open, 1 closed)
  - Only ask the open OR closed question to someone
  - Record their answer with a voice recording app (e.g. voice memos)
  - Transcribe the interview with a transcription app or manually
- Next steps:
  - Reconvene on teams @11:00 Monday 11 on teams for 1 hour to discuss results and put in report

# Week 3 Meeting:

Length: Is one longer than the other on average?

Context: Which response gave you more context or background?

Comfort: Did the interviewee seem more comfortable or willing to elaborate in response to one type of question?

Perspective: Which question helped you understand the interviewee’s perspective better?

Clarify: Did either question lead to a clearer understanding of the challenge?

Future practice: Based on this experience, how might you change your interview questions in future?

Write a brief report answering the above (

**Length**: Closed was shorter, but was not significant and found variations were larger between students

**Context**:

- Balanced, different perspectives for questions
- Both questions were effective in providing necessary context

**Comfort**:

- Both questions, open invited them more so

**Perspective:**

- Interviewees provided perspective before answering both
- Open gave them opportunity for slightly more

**Clarify:**

- Closed question allowed us to get clarity on the actual subject matter
- Open question allowed for subject-matter adjacent items

**Future Practise:**

- Both questions were very important and did provide useful information regarding the challenge. However, the findings support that the interviewee was more important than the question itself. (this may be due to the vast scope of the question)

## Report (to be submitted 24h after team notification)

### Liam B Report:

**Length**:
The difference in length between responses was minimal when comparing data from the closed- and open-ended questions. Whilst the argument could be made that responses to the open-ended questions were slightly longer, data was mixed from across the group. The findings supported the conclusion that variations between students’ personalities was the largest contributing factor to response length rather than style of question.

**Context**:
Both styles of question provided adequate context. While the closed- and open-ended questions did provide different perspectives from the respondents, both styles of question were effective in providing the context necessary to understand their position on the matter. Even for the closed-ended questions, students were giving their context on a matter unprompted, only resorting to simple yes/no answers when follow-up closed questions were asked to reaffirm or counter their position. However, by this stage the necessary context had most likely already been gained.

**Comfort**:
The respondents felt comfortable answering both styles of question. The open-ended question did allow participants more freedom to elaborate or expand their answers, and this was demonstrated. However, both sets of questions allowed students to feel comfortable answering. This could be seen because the necessary interviewing procedure was followed before asking questions. Namely, interviewers asked interviewees on whether they were comfortable answering questions about the subject on-record. This allowed the respondent to affirm their commitment to be interviewed, or back out if they so wished. Therefore, all students being interviewed wished to be so before they were asked any questions on-record.

**Perspective:**
Perspective can be seen to tie in greatly into the point around context. The respondents perspective is often informed by their context, and this was evident through the answers received. When questioning participants in both the open and closed question sets, they often would provide an explanation on where they stood before answering. This could have been information regarding their degree, how many years they had been at UQ or other extenuating circumstances they deemed may have been relevant to answering the question. This is consistent about the point about context. It was noted that asking follow-up questions in both sets of questions did allow for further explanation of stances or previous experiences that shaped how the interviewee sees the problem today. As these questions tended towards being more open-ended, an argument could be made that, while closed questions do allow for perspective, open-ended questions permit this to a greater extent.

**Clarity:**
Both closed- and open-ended questions allowed for further clarity from the interviewee. Closed questions tended to provide greater clarity on the relevant subject matter. As this style of question often focuses on quizzing the respondent on a particular set of circumstances, asking further questions in this vein allowed them to clarify and rehash matter that they had brought up to affirm their opinion on the problem discussed. Therefore, this permits the interviewer, upon revision of the interview, to better understand the perspectives given to them and make better-informed decisions on a particular issue. The open-ended questions provided different results. Namely, the clarification offered by interviewees would often be subject-matter adjacent. In practice, this meant that the conversation was able to flow to different areas that had not been considered by the interviewing team as being a problem. This allowed the interviewer to gain a greater understanding of the problems that exist within the broader challenge being faced. In turn, this permits the team to refine or redirect the solution being developed to attack the best or most relevant problem, rather than the initial problem identified.

**Future Practise:**
In conclusion, both questions proved useful to understanding the target audience and provided useful information. The findings suggest that both closed and open questions can be useful in an interview setting to get the best set of information from the interviewee, when done right. However, one unexpected finding was that the type of person being interviewed mattered as much as the question being asked. Namely, a good question being asked to someone who is naturally willing to talk and elaborate is much more likely to yield results than a great question asked to someone who is naturally more reserved and less talkative.

# Week 4 Meeting:

Chosen challenge:

### **Selecting courses**

Once enrolled in a program, students receive a course plan. However, still many choices remain: can I switch do core courses in a different order to the plan? Which electives should I take? Which major and courses should I take for specific career paths?

**Challenge:** The challenge is to innovate a software-based solution to help students to navigate selection of majors, courses, etc., throughout various stages of their degree program.

Hypotheses:

- It is harder than it needs to be to pick courses while maintaining prerequisites

Value propositions

- Students wish for an easier way to find prerequisites
- Students find the current course selection system convoluted
- Students wish to find a course that will help them diverse their carrier paths
- Students find that needing to choose courses in a specific order is important to their time at UQ

Customer relations

- Students wish to have a more integrated solution (rather than 3+ programs to view information: [MySI.net](http://MySI.net), allocate+, etc.)
- Students want to have more options for class allocation and timetable during the semester

Channels

- Students are forced to use alternative programs to cobble together course plans
- Word of mouth, spreading through

Customer segments

- Our customers are comprised of students

Interview questions:

- Would you find it beneficial to have a more seamless system to apply for courses?
- In your experience, has the course application process been a seamless system, is there any room for tangible improvement?
- In your experience at UQ, how important is it to you to be able to effectively view and choose your courses based on prerequisites?
- What problems have you encountered when planning your courses? (focus follow-up)
- How do you find the integration between the numerous websites that UQ uses to display and utilise information regarding courses?
- Are
