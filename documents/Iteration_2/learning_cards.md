**Hypothesis: people wish to take the same as their friends where possible**

*Observation:* Choosing courses with friends was a secondary priority for most people interviewed, behind completing their course. However some students reported feeling that they would rather co-ordinate with their friends externally.

*Learning and Insights:* We learned that students value their friends’ choices when considering

Therefore we will accept this hypothesis as true.

*Evidence:*
- “[it’s] something I try to do after I selected [courses]” - [Caleb Yates Interview 1]()
- “Absolutely in fact I've got stat 1301 right now that I specifically chose so I could be with a friend from high school." - [Rafael Chase	 interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_2/rafael_chase/rafael_chase_2025-09-14_1.md)
-  “I usually choose for my degree first because that is the most important thing. And then I check with my friends and determine if it's possible to be in like classes together.” - [Patrick Elgey Interview 1]()
- "It's significant when I'm... talking to people who are doing... a similar course structure to me... Because it's like we have to complete the same units, the same courses by the end of our degree." - [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-18_1.md)


**Hypothesis: students plan their course in reference to a long-term course plan**

Test: we will interview students to see if they are considering how their course should be set out long-term
Metric: We will measure if students have a long-term plan considering what courses they will be taking in all semesters >50%

*Observation:* We observed that many students did not have a full-length course plan at the moment, but there did exist students with rigid plans - especially among those with little options in their degree.

*Learning and Insights:* Students all anticipate future change that will impact a full plan. Students also generally would like to create plans, but have not got around to it due to difficulty

Therefore we will reject this hypothesis

*Evidence:*
- "[planning too far in advance isn't useful] because things change, obviously." - [Liam Bienkowski Interview 1]()
- "...you've got to be prepared if your plans change..." - [Patrick Elgey Interview 1]()
- "I have planned those 2 courses, but anything around that, I have not really even looked to plan with that" - [Liam Bienkowski Interview 2]()
- - "...I don't have a setup plan. I have classes, I’d like to do sometime in the next 4 years, but no, I don't have a specific plan at all after like the next 2 semesters." - [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-18_1.md)


**Hypothesis: students would like a forum to interact with other people who have completed courses they have already completed**

Test: We will interview students to find out if this system is desired and deemed as useful.
Metric: We will measure if students want a system like this to streamline the process of when they should take courses etc. majority

*Observation:* that majority of students interviewed stated that they would prefer that a forum of this type exists, and that they would find use out of it

*Learning and Insights:* It is not clear whether staff should be present or not in a forum environment, but further collection of information will likely not resolve this as the interviews were pretty evenly split. Interviewees are concerned about how moderation or lack thereof would impact the space.

Therefore we will accept this hypothesis as true.

*Evidence:*
- "I think that would be beneficial for myself and many of my peers" & "if it were staff moderated, potentially, there's room for bias and manipulation" - [Caleb Yates Interview 2]()
- "Yeah, I think that'll be very useful" - [Rafael Chase Interview 1]()
- "I believe it would um, beneficial to see a very recent student perspective on the course, uh, any key things about it that you'd only know if you had just done it." - [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-22_4.md)


**Hypothesis: students don’t understand how their major affects how credit points are counted towards their degree**

Test: We will interview students to find out if they understand how credit points are counted towards their major
Metric: We will measure how many people are aware of their major and which courses are relevant to their chosen major >50%

*Observation:* students do not really understand the issues that may arise with their credit points, but are confident in their ability to figure it out.

*Learning and Insights:* that generally we as interviewers were also not fully aware of this, and thus struggled to ask the right questions. We also note that students would be in favor of having multiple planners.

Therefore we will accept this hypothesis as true.

*Evidence:*
- "Um, I mean, it's online. There's a lot, but like not off the top of my head, but yes, I know where to go to look at it. I have to look them up to go and check, like, where my, on my degree, which subjects I need to do."
