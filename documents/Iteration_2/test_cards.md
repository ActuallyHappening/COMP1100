**Hypothesis**: people wish to take the same courses as their friends where possible

**Test**: interview students to see if they specifically go out of their way to do the same courses as friends

**Metric**: As well, we will find out how much time it takes people to collaborate, and if they know of the current methods to compare timetables built into UQ timetable.

**Criteria**: If this is the case, we estimate most students wish to take courses with friends, sitting above roughly 50%

Therefore, we will ask:
1) Do you try to take courses with your friends where possible?
2) Is this a significant factor in choosing for your courses, or would you say it’s something that you try to do after selecting courses?
3) Did you know SI-Net has a built-in way to share timetables?
4) Is this a system that you use often if you did know about it, and would you say this is because it’s useful for planning with friends?
5) Do you think it would be more beneficial if there was a way you could better collaborate prior to selecting courses, or do you already confer with friends prior to selecting courses?



**Hypothesis**: we believe that students plan their course in reference to a long-term course plan

**Test**: we will interview students to see if they are considering how their course should be set out long-term

**Metric**: We will measure if students have a long-term plan considering what courses they will be taking in all semesters

**Criteria**: We are right if over 50% of students have made a long-term plan with course codes/similar items to be certain of where their degree is taking them.

Therefore, we will ask:
1) Have you planned your courses for the upcoming two terms?
2) Do you worry that planning too far in advance isn’t useful?
3) When planning in advance, how likely do you think your preferences will change over time which will change your plan?
4) Have you planned any courses more than two terms in advance?
5) Have you planned all your courses yourself, or relied on a UQ advisor or course planner?



**Hypothesis**: Students would like a forum to interact with other people who have completed courses they have already completed

**Test**: We will interview students to find out if this system is desired and deemed as useful.

**Metric**: We will measure if students want a system like this to streamline the process fo when they should take courses etc. 

**Criteria**: If this is the case, we are correct if it is found a majority of students wish for this system to be implemented.

Therefore, we will ask:
1) Would you like to see a system where previous participants of a course can leave a note of a summary of the course?
2) Would you read short opinions of courses you were thinking of taking from past students?
3) Would you like a system similar to EdStem prior to choosing courses so as to understand what actually happens in a course?
4) Would you participate in a system where you aid other students?
5) Would you prefer a system where course staff are present in the forums or not present in the forums

*note from raf mid interview, what if we have course positivity from the end of semester reviews for each course?
