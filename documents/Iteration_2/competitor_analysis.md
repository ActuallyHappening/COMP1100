# Insights and Strategy
| Insights | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| Official university tools are accurate but frustrating to use - students see them as a chore rather than a help. | Focus on creating an experience that feels effortless and even enjoyable. A smooth, intuitive design will be our biggest advantage. |
| Students currently juggle multiple disconnected tools - a planner here, discussion boards there, review sites elsewhere. Nothing ties everything together. | Position ourselves as the one-stop solution that brings all these needs together in a cohesive, simple way that reduces complexity. |
| No existing tool helps students answer their biggest "what if" questions about changing majors or exploring different paths through their degree. | Make our flexible scenario planner the heart of what we offer - it's not just a feature, but our core value proposition for helping students feel empowered. |
| Our most valuable features (like student reviews) depend on having an active community. An empty platform won't help anyone. | Our initial focus needs to be on building community momentum - seeding content, encouraging early adopters, and making sure the first users feel their contributions matter. |
| Some competitors have large student audiences but don't address academic planning needs, leaving a gap we can fill. | Explore ways to reach these existing audiences by solving a problem they experience but isn't being addressed by platforms they already use. |
