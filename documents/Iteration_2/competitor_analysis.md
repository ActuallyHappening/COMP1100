Our project UQ Plan It aims to solve current UI issues, so that UI will be easy to use and navigate and fast for undergraduate UQ Students who are planning which courses to enroll in during their course. We believe that our unique value proposition is the ability to have multi-user engagement features. The following competitor analysis includes a comparison table, SWOT analysis of key competitors, and strategic insights based on our findings
## COMPARISON TABLE

| Competitor | Direct/Indirect | Target | Key Features | Pricing Model| Strengths | Weaknesses | Other Notes | Threats |
|------------|-----------------|--------|--------------|--------------|-----------|------------|------------|---------|
| Student VIP | Indirect | students | marketplace, textbooks, notes | none| Network, large active user base | focus is on commerce, not on academic, not UQ moderated so cannot be used by the uni | Solution is not well known and its features are not as built out as they could be | This platform seeks to threaten our solution by providing an alternate system to leave reviews, discrediting our solution |
| UQ My Course Planner | Direct | students | validation | none |authoritative | inflexible | as it is found in a PDF form for most students, it does provide a very good way of viewing courses but falls down due to the inability to manipulate it | This solution threatens our project as it is the current status quo for many UQ students planning, being the thing that needs to be disrupted |
| Uni of Melb My Course Planner | Direct | students (uni-specific) | planning courses in line with majors/minors | none | official, accurate | inflexible, isolated (not directly applicable to UQ) | Uni of Melb course planner is most similar to the solution that we propose, but comments from other users regarding courses cannot be viewed | This poses a threat to our solution if this solution was to be ported over to UQ as it provides many of the same features, even without friends/reviews |
| EdStem Discussion Boards | Indirect | classmates | Q&A | none | Immediate | disorganized | [interviews](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-20_3.md) attest that the edstem board can get cluttered and full of unnesecary informatation very quickly. | This solution poses a threat to our product as it can provide an alternate UQ-endorsed place to discuss courses, with a different application to that which we seek to perform |
| Campusvue | Direct | students | scheduling | none | combines schedule, tasks, grade in one personal view | not tailored to specific uni degree prerequisites | can provide a good base model, but as it tries to tailor to many different prerequisites it can be restricted by its own success | This solution threatens our product as it is a solution that many people use due to its adaptability, meaing our solution must perform in our market segment better than it |

## Strategic Insights
Overall, walking through the different competitors, it is clear that our solution seeks to improve on each of them in different aspects. The main issue that we have found from interviewees is the presence of the numerous different existing services (as exhibited above) is a burden onto students when trying to complete a course. Therefore, our solution seeks to consolidate the major aspects of these services into one piece of software. Whilst aspects such as timetabling of individual classes in a semester fall outside the scope of the MVP and so will still require a separate website, key elements such as gathering, viewing, choosing and ordering courses (which can occur on as many as 4 different pieces of software today) can be consolidated down into one piece of software. A model similar to that of the University of Melbourne could be pursued. However, to differentiate ourselves from their solution to stand out in the market, the implementation of the user engagement features (friends, comments) would be included in the solution.
