**ITERATION ONE + TWO**:

# Value Proposition Canvas

### Customer Profile:
Undergraduate UQ Students commencing in Semester 1 of a year doing Bachelor of Computer Science who are planning which courses to enroll in during their course.

**Customer Jobs:**
Our customers want to:
Iteration One:
- Plan their degree at a higher level, including their majors and/or minors
- Make sure they finish all the required courses for their degree / majors
- Choose subjects for each semester, making sure they are available in the correct semesters
- Choose subjects with having done all the proper pre-requisites

Iteration Two:
- Take courses with friends where possible. 
- Want to know more about a course from other students / staff before enrolling.

**Customer pains:**
Our customers are pained by:
Iteration One:
- UQ websites being bad
- Often planning out courses in a separate space
- The current system being outdated
- Current system being difficult to use

Iteration Two:
- It is difficult to align with friends without explicitly cooperating with them outside of UQ services. 
- My SI-Net is notoriously difficult to use, and so customers do not know of current ways to cooperate with friends.
- There is no clear way to converse with students who have finished a course unless you personally know someone. 
- Students are sometimes unsure as to what is actually involved in a course based off of the profile alone.
- Students are sometimes unsure on how a change to a different major/course would be possible or impact them

**Customer gains:**
Our customers stand to gain by:
Iteration One:
- Saving time in the course application process
- Saving effort when applying for courses
- Having less stress induced by course planning
- Having greater certainty for course selections
- Experiencing greater appreciation for possible paths in a given course

Iteration Two:
- A more seamless system to interact and cooperate in course planning with friends.
- A system that allows students to see active feedback for the course from students who have previously taken it.
- Students will know more about the courses they are going to take. 


### Value Proposition Map:
Our solution should attack the following:

**Products/Services:**
Our product should aim to have some/all of the following services:
Iteration One:
- One place to have all courses documented
- One course viewer, showing the requirements and relationships between all the relevant courses
- Combined planner showing semester limitations and pre-requisite limitations

Iteration Two:
- Integrate systems similar to UQ review so students have a more clear idea on course feedback. 
- Integrate systems to allow friends to choose courses together should the situation arise.

**Pain relievers:**
Our solution seeks to relieve the following pains:
Iteration One:
- Fixing current UI issues, so that UI will be easy to use and navigate and fast
- Ending non-personalised services with a solution that will adapt to what classes you have already done

Iteration Two:
- Make it clear what information is avaliable for a course via a similar system to [UQ review](https://studentvip.com.au/uq/subjects), so students are immediately aware.
- Students will be better and more seamlessly able to choose courses with friends. 

**Gain creators:**
Iteration One:
Our solution seeks to create the following gains:
- Usage of a seamless system with everything in one place
- Allowing viewing of what other people are planning on doing

Iteration Two:
- Our solution aims to (like iteration one) create a more seamless system with additional information that we know students would like based on interviews. 


## Evaluation of Hypotheses (Iteration one):

### Accepted Hypotheses (Iteration one):

“we believed students would invest more time than strictly necessary in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites.” We accepted this hypothesis as we found a strong trend amongst most of the interviews that students found the process to be cumbersome, and longer than what they felt was necessary. This links to some of the pains mentioned above. Mainly, customers being pained by a bad website, with offerings being found in different places and the current system being outdated and difficult to use all proved to be concerns raised by interviewees, as seen in [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 1 Interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-19_1.md). There is then a valid pain reliever to improving UI and layout, and the ability to create a gain by implementing a seamless system with everything in one place. By extension, customer gains 1 and 2 can be accepted. 

“We believed students enrolled in courses having already completed the appropriate prerequisites.” We accepted this hypothesis as we found students were more often than not aware of prerequisites, and actively completing them prior to completing branching courses. However, it is important to note students agreed this was always more difficult than they felt. I.e. they agreed a more seamless system would be highly beneficial. Evidence can be found in [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 1 Interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/week_3_interviews.md). From this, users mentioned how a personalised experience advising of prerequisites would be very useful to solving the current issues, which can be seen to be an idenfified pain reliever. Therefore, we can accept customer gain 3. 

“We believed students who kept a plan for the courses they do were forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it because of the current system.” This was found to be true. Students were unable to find the UQ planner at times, and resorted to other methods of planning, or following their friends / worrying about it when it came time to select courses. This can be seen through some of our [interviews](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-25_3.md). This can therefore be linked to the pain of students needing to plan courses in a seperate space. To create gains, we could accept the hypothesis that viewing what others are doing could be a viable item to implement, especially with its popularitary in allocate+. Therefore, we seek to create gains by relieving stress and creating greater certainty in course selections. 

### Rejected Hypotheses (Iteration one)

We rejected the hypothesis “Save time in the course application process” for a customer gain, as applying for courses when you know the course codes and/or names was actually really easy. Instead, the research component was where students seemed to be struggling the most. “So like, its kind of a you problem, the current system functions quite well if you have the necessary information and if you have gone into enough research into which course you want to do, you should also know the name of the course.” [Caleb Yates Iteration 1 Interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_9_1_7.md)

We rejected the hypothesis “We believed students made erroneous selections during course planning as a consequence of a lack of proper communication as prerequisites are not properly communicated,” as we found the students we interviewed didn’t choose incorrect classes due to pre-requisites. “Yes I am, because they are very nicely laid out right next to the course when I'm looking at them.” [Caleb Yates Iteration 1 Interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_9_1_7.md). Where students struggled with this process, the students took extra precautions instead of choosing the wrong course. "I haven't yet, but it's definitely something I try to avoid, and it's something I make sure to try and look at before I enrol in anything." [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 1 Interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-27_7.md).

We rejected the hypothesis “We believed students were unaware of the selection of courses offered by the university.” It turns out the course program page for degrees lists all the relevant courses in a convenient way that was obvious to the people who were interviewed. “Because if I go to the program major and what is within my degree on the UQ website it has all the courses that could give me credit and thats where I learn of courses I want to take.” [Caleb Yates Iteration 1 Interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_9_1_7.md). This tied into the customer gain of gaining a greater appreciation for possible paths. This hypothesis was subsequentially also rejected. 


## Job prioritisation (Iteration one):
After testing the hypotheses in the business model canvas and the value proposition canvas, we have decided to prioritise the following jobs when moving forward with solution development:
1) Choosing subjects
2) Choosing subjects based off of having done the prerequisites
3) Choosing subjects based off of which semesters they are offered by the university
4) Choosing subjects that will integrate well into a wider course plan
5) Once all of the above is done, being able to save and refence back to the chosen course plan



## Evaluation of Hypothesis (Iteration two):

### Accepted Hypotheses (Iteration two):
"We believed students wished to take the same courses as their friends where possible." We decided to accept this hypothesis as it was found overwhelmingly that most students favour taking courses with friends. Whilst it wasn't necessarily a significant driving factor in course selections, it was still found that students wished to align courses with friends after having completed selections and enrolement. This also links back to the importance of some of the customer jobs listed above. 

Evidence:
- "Absolutely in fact I've got stat 1301 right now that I specifically chose so I could be with a friend from high school." [Rafael Chase Iteration 2 Interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_2/rafael_chase/rafael_chase_2025-09-14_1.md)
- "it's significant when I'm like talking to people who are doing like a similar course structure to me." [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-18_2.md)

"We believed students would like a forum to interact with other people who have completed courses they have already completed." This hypothesis was accepted as it was agreed upon by students in interviews to be unanimously. As hypothesised in our customer jobs, it was found in the interviews that students sometimes struggled with understanding what a course was, what they would be doing and the type of content / assessment required to be completed based off of provided information in course profiles and the like. Students appreciated the possibiliy to talk with other students who have previously completed a course as it would provide them a greater understanding of what would actually happen in a course.

Evidence:
- "It would be very useful. Like, it gives students a good expectation of what to expect, right?...Yes, certainly. Like, if there was, like, a reading system or something, that would be pretty good. Like, if you, if students could rate a course, maybe like, different aspects, like, how interesting it was or, like, how difficult it was, right? That would definitely be taken into consideration choosing courses."
[Rafael Chase Iteration 2 Interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_2/rafael_chase/rafael_chase_2025-09-16_3.md)
- "Oh, yeah, that would be definitely, really good, because currently, like, the course subscriptions on a lot of the ones I see on the program's domain. They're really not insightful into what the course is about at all." [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-18_1.md)

"Students don’t understand how their major affects how credit points are counted towards their degree." Whilst some students were quite aware of how these decisions would impact credit, as well as other related issues that could arise, the general consensus suggests that students are still very much so struggling with this process. In some cases, memorisation was resorted to, as well as rigourous planning had the students actually been mostly aware of these issues. It is regarded that this current implementation, or lack thereof, requires more depth and nuance to ensure a smoother implemntation and solution for students when considering course planning. These were factors mentioned within the customer pains of students being unaware of how to approach changing a major or course. 

Evidence:
- "It probably would have been helpful while organising however I have memorised the different majors enough that it is no longer necessary"
[Caleb Yates Iteration 2 Interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_2/caleb_yates/CALEB_2025_9_10_1.md)
- "I have to look them up to go and check, like, where my, on my degree, which subjects I need to do." [Liam Bienkowski Iteration 2 Interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_2/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-09-18_1.md)

### Rejected Hypotheses (iteration two):

"We believed that students plan their course in reference to a long-term course plan." We rejected this hypothesis as it was found most students were not planning for the long haul. When this was the case, it was often a result of an already rigid plan for a course with little to no wiggle room. Most students revealed they would 'go with the flow' and simply choose courses based on what either their friends were doing, or recommended pairings via the UQ planner. This isn't to say students refrain from long term planning, but the process was generally found to be more short-sided, and limited to one, sometimes two semesters in advance. As a consequence, we decided that this was not a valid hypothesis. The rationale for this can be found in [Iteration 2 Learning Card 2](../iteration_2/learning_cards.md)

## Job prioritisation (Iteration two):
After testing the hypotheses in the business model canvas and the value proposition canvas, we have decided to reprioritise the following jobs when moving forward with solution development:
1) Choosing subjects
2) Choosing subjects based off of having done the prerequisites
3) Choosing subjects based off of which semesters they are offered by the university
4) Being able to review comments made by other students on the courses being done
5) Once all of the above is done, being able to save and refence back to the chosen course plan
6) Being able to do all of the above with reference to friends

## Evaluation of Hypothesis (Iteration three):

### Accepted Hypotheses (Iteration three):
"We believe students find it more seamless now that there exists only one central tab to select courses". It was found on the whole that many studetns would prefer our system of using one tab at a time, and believe that this is a major 'customer gain', in the sense that this fixes, and fixes well, the main issue when it comes to choosing courses.
