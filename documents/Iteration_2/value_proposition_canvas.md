## Evaluation of Hypotheses

### Accepted Hypotheses:
“we believed students would invest more time than strictly necessary in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites.” We accepted this hypothesis as we found a strong trend amongst most of the interviews that students found the process to be cumbersome, and longer than what they felt was necessary. This links to some of the pains mentioned above. Mainly, customers being pained by a bad website, with offerings being found in different places and the current system being outdated and difficult to use all proved to be concerns raised by interviewees, as seen in [Liam Bienkowski interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-19_1.md). There is then a valid pain reliever to improving UI and layout, and the ability to create a gain by implementing a seamless system with everything in one place. By extension, customer gains 1 and 2 can be accepted. 

“We believed students enrolled in courses having already completed the appropriate prerequisites.” We accepted this hypothesis as we found students were more often than not aware of prerequisites, and actively completing them prior to completing branching courses. However, it is important to note students agreed this was always more difficult than they felt. I.e. they agreed a more seamless system would be highly beneficial. Evidence can be found in [Liam Bienkowski interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/week_3_interviews.md). From this, users mentioned how a personalised experience advising of prerequisites would be very useful to solving the current issues, which can be seen to be an idenfified pain reliever. Therefore, we can accept customer gain 3. 

“We believed students who kept a plan for the courses they do were forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it because of the current system.” This was found to be true. Students were unable to find the UQ planner at times, and resorted to other methods of planning, or following their friends / worrying about it when it came time to select courses. This can be seen through some of our [interviews](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-25_3.md). This can therefore be linked to the pain of students needing to plan courses in a seperate space. To create gains, we could accept the hypothesis that viewing what others are doing could be a viable item to implement, especially with its popularitary in allocate+. Therefore, we seek to create gains by relieving stress and creating greater certainty in course selections. 

### Rejected Hypotheses
We rejected the hypothesis “Save time in the course application process” for a customer gain, as applying for courses when you know the course codes and/or names was actually really easy. Instead, the research component was where students seemed to be struggling the most. “So like, its kind of a you problem, the current system functions quite well if you have the necessary information and if you have gone into enough research into which course you want to do, you should also know the name of the course.” [Caleb Yates interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_9_1_7.md)

We rejected the hypothesis “We believed students made erroneous selections during course planning as a consequence of a lack of proper communication as prerequisites are not properly communicated,” as we found the students we interviewed didn’t choose incorrect classes due to pre-requisites. “Yes I am, because they are very nicely laid out right next to the course when I'm looking at them.” [Caleb Yates interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_9_1_7.md). Where students struggled with this process, the students took extra precautions instead of choosing the wrong course. "I haven't yet, but it's definitely something I try to avoid, and it's something I make sure to try and look at before I enrol in anything." [Liam Bienkowski interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-27_7.md).

We rejected the hypothesis “We believed students were unaware of the selection of courses offered by the university.” It turns out the course program page for degrees lists all the relevant courses in a convenient way that was obvious to the people who were interviewed. “Because if I go to the program major and what is within my degree on the UQ website it has all the courses that could give me credit and thats where I learn of courses I want to take.” [Caleb Yates interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_9_1_7.md). This tied into the customer gain of gaining a greater appreciation for possible paths. This hypothesis was subsequentially also rejected. 


## Job prioritisation:
After testing the hypotheses in the business model canvas and the value proposition canvas, we have decided to prioritise the following jobs when moving forward with solution development:
1) Choosing subjects
2) Choosing subjects based off of having done the prerequisites
3) Choosing subjects based off of which semesters they are offered by the university
4) Choosing subjects that will integrate well into a wider course plan
5) Once all of the above is done, being able to save and refence back to the chosen course plan
