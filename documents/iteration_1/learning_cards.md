# Learning Cards:

We believed that \[target\] were \[showing behaviour / display interest in \] \[for reason Y\]

We observed that \[explanation of results with link to hard evidence\]

From this we learnt \[findings from the interviews, including key areas\]

Therefore, we will \[accept/reject hypothesis\]

### Learning Card 1
**Hypothesis: we believed students would invest more time than strictly necessary in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites.**

*Observation:* we observed this to be true. Students would have several tabs open at all times and would often get confused or find it more difficult than necessary to navigate the process. Numerous individuals cited spending above the established 30 minute timeframe given in [test card 1](test_cards.md) as a metric. 

*Learning and insights:* from this, we learned, students wish for a more streamlined and well-integrated structure for selecting courses.

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis

*Evidence:*
- “Oh, I spend like, like when I'm, like researching my course to make sure I get the right subjects for the prerequisites, I can spend over, like half an hour an hour, because it's so cumbersome, just, like, traveling, like navigating all of this- navigating this UI and over to different sites and like, keeping track of everything, yeah.” - [Liam Bienkowski interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-19_1.md)
- "I spent a little more than the average person to just plan everything out" - [Patrick Elgey interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_08_27_3.md)

### Learning Card 2
**Hypothesis: We believed students made erroneous selections during course planning as a consequence of a lack of proper communication as prerequisites are not properly communicated.**

*Observation:* we observed, students were still careful with how they selected courses in spite of a difficult system. Nowhere near 50% of respondants erroneously chose the wrong course, with this being incredibly rare in responses. 

*Learning and insights:* from this, we learned, students are nonetheless willing to spend more time checking course requirements and enrollments to ensure they do not make careless mistakes in spite of a taxing system.

Therefore, we will disregard this particular hypothesis as not necessarily true in most cases. 

*Evidence:*
- *So I'm assuming you've never enrolled in a subject without having done all its pre-requisites?*<br/>"I have accidentally, but, once I realised that I quickly changed subjects" - [Caleb Yates interview 5](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_8_25_5.md)
- "I knew of friends who did, but within the first couple of weeks they ended up being able to catch up with the one they needed to do" - [Patrick Elgey interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_08_27_3.md)
- *Yeah, and so, um. when it comes to actually enrolling into your courses, have you ever, like accidentally, like, almost, or have you actually made a selection of a course that you've realised in hindsight, you can't take because of a prerequisite or similar?*<br/>"I haven't yet, but it's definitely something I try to avoid, and it's something I make sure to try and look at before I enrol in anything." - [Liam Bienkowski interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-27_7.md)

### Learning Card 3
**Hypothesis: We believed students enrolled in courses having already completed the appropriate prerequisites.**

*Observation:* we observed, students were always completing prerequisites prior to enrolling in a new course. Practically nobody had ever enrolled in a course without having completed its appropriate prerequisites. However, students may intend to if circumstances arise.

*Learning and insights:* from this, we learned, students are wanting to be well aware of their course requirements and prerequisites. 

Therefore, we will: accept this hypothesis as true.

*Evidence:* 
- “Yes. Yeah. I have got like a sort of plan for my degree. So I do know generally the prerequisites to do. So I was looking for them when I was searching through.” - [Liam Bienkowski interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-20_2.md)
- *Another interesting question, would you ever consider doing a course without having done its pre-requisites?*<br/>"No no"<br/>*So I'm assuming you've never enrolled in a course without first having done its pre-requisites?*<br/>"Yeah no" - [Caleb Yates interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_8_22_3.md)
- "I did actually... (describes doing a similar course on exchange)" - [Patrick Elgey interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_08_27_3.md)
- "I would!... Because, due to some courses only being provided every once a semester, and that would require me to end up having to miss a course for that semester and I'll be, basically, lagging behind maybe one full course. I'd rather just do it now rather than having to wait until it's available." - [Patrick Elgey Interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_08_25_2.md)

### Learning Card 4
**Hypothesis: We believed students were unaware of the selection of courses offered by the university.**

*Observation:* we observed, students don’t invest too much time into elective courses, often preferring ease over practical application. When interviewed, most repondants with electives did not make the choice off of interest. Rather, satisfying future course demands or choosing an easy course proved to be the main driving factors. 

*Learning and insights:* from this, we learned, being aware of available courses isn’t important to a lot of students. 

Therefore, we will disregard this hypothesis as unimportant to the application. 

*Evidence:*
- “Uh. Probably not really. That's just because… the main subjects that are of interest to me are the psychology ones and I’m already doing all the psychology ones anyways as the core. Like, maybe I grab a bio one, but, like, generally, I, I only, I really struggle with finding courses I thought were going to be interesting in terms of electives, most of them were even grabbed because I thought they might have been useful, or they were going to be easy this semester. And I think it was like one I picked could it look good, it looked interesting, but other than that, like, it was a bit of struggle to find one that I found interesting. My area of interest is what with psychological studies, which I am already doing a lot of.” - [Liam Bienkowski interview 4](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-20_4.md)

### Learning Card 5
**Hypothesis: We believed students who kept a plan for the courses they do were forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it because of the current system.**

*Observation:* we observed that all students so far affirmed that they had to keep a plan on another platform, as well as opting to select courses based on what friends were doing. Nearly all respondants had resorted to third-party softwares to plan courses, expressing annoyance that the university did not have one of its own. 

*Learning and insights:* from this, we learned, there is a market for a streamlined and more rigid structure provided to students. Likewise, collaborating on courses seemed to be important for some people in their selections.

Therefore, we will accept this hypothesis.

*Evidence:* 
- “I have it on a google sheet” - [Patrick Elgey interview 1](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_08_25_1.md) 
- “I mostly have put it down onto a simple document…” [Patrick Elgey interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_08_27_3.md)
- "I had an excel spreadsheet specially for me" - [Patrick Elgey interview 3](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_08_27_3.md)
- “Um, because I am preMed, there is a lot of stuff around that \[course planning\], so not too hard. But I imagine other degrees would be a bit harder if they didn't have that. Because that saved me.” - [Liam Bienkowski interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-20_2.md)
- "I usually just write it \[the course plan\] down in a separate, like, word document plan that I've got set up." - [Liam Bienkowski interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-27_7.md)
