# Test Cards

We believe that \[target\] are \[showing behaviour / display interest in \] \[for reason Y\]

To verify that, we will \[undertake behaviour\] to \[identify behaviour\]

And measure \[particular variable\]

We are right if \[some measurable statement\]

Therefore, we will ask \[specific questions\]

### Test Card 1
**Hypothesis: we believe students invest more time than strictly necessary in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites.**

*Test:* To verify this, we will interview students to identify redundancies in the process.

*Metric:* As well, we will aim to measure how long it takes to select courses for the semester.

*Criteria:* If this is the case, we estimate students will be spending over 30 minutes trying

Therefore, we will ask the following:

1) Would you find it beneficial to have a more seamless system to apply for courses?  
2) How do you find the integration between the numerous websites UQ uses to display and utilise information regarding courses?

### Test Card 2
**Hypothesis: We believe that students make erroneous selections during course planning as a consequence of a lack of proper communication as prerequisites are not properly communicated.**

*Test:* To verify this, we will interview students to see if they have ever chosen a course they regret for credit reasons.

*Metric:* As well, we wish to measure the amount of students who have experienced something to this effect.

*Criteria:* Should this be the case, we estimate approximately 50% of students have experienced this type of issue.

Therefore, we will ask:

1) Have you ever regretted taking a particular course sooner as a result of feeling underprepared, or for credit reasons?  
2) How often are you aware of course prerequisites, or mutually exclusive courses during the enrolment process? How much do they play into your decision?

### Test Card 3
**Hypothesis: We believe students enrol in courses having already completed the appropriate prerequisites.**

*Test:* To verify this, we will interview students to see if they would consider doing a course prior to completing its prerequisite.

*Metric:* As well, we wish to measure how many students would take this option.

*Criteria:* Our hypothesis is correct if the majority (~70%) of students would always complete a prerequisite

Therefore, we will ask:

1) Would you ever consider doing a course without having completed its associated prerequisites? Have you ever actually done this?  
2) How important do you consider completing prerequisites prior to enrolling in a course?  
3) Do you wish my SI-net would bar you from enrolling in a course without having completed its associated prerequisites?

### Test Card 4
**Hypothesis: We believe students are unaware of the selection of courses offered by the university.**

*Test:* To verify this, we will interview students with electives on how they have chosen their subjects.

*Metric:* As well, we wish to measure how many students want to diversify their degree with other general electives they take interest in.

*Criteria:* We are correct if it is found that approximately 50% of students want to do more than the course they are enrolled in.

Therefore, we will ask:

1) How do you choose your electives for your degree?  
2) Would you consider doing a larger selection of courses if you knew what was on offer?

### Test Card 5
**Hypothesis: We believe students who keep a plan for the courses they do are forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it.**

*Test:* To verify this, we will interview students about their course plans

*Metric:* As well, we wish to know what they used to construct it.

*Criteria:* We are correct if most (~70%) students agree or take issue with course planning in more complicated systems

Therefore, we will ask: 

1) Do you have a plan for what courses you are doing?  
2) What platform is this plan on? How do you access it?
