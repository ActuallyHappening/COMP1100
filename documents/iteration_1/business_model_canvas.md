# Business Model Canvas

**Customer Segments**
- We believe that our customers are undergraduate students who need to select courses every semester.

This hypothesis was accepted. The amount of feedback recieved in interviews demonstrate a demand from undergraduate students for a solution in this field to be developed. As shown in the evaluation of hypotheses in the [value proposition campus](value_proposition_canvas.md), many of the assumed pains and gains of this customer base were proven to be correct. 

- We believe students invest more time than they would like in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites. [Test Card 1](test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Learning Card 1](learning_cards.md).

- We believe that students make erroneous selections during course planning as a consequence of a lack of proper communication as prerequisites are not properly communicated. [Test Card 2](test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was discarded for reasons found in [Learning Card 2](learning_cards.md).

- We believe students enrol in courses having already completed the appropriate prerequisites. [Test Card 3](test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Learning Card 3](learning_cards.md).

- We believe students are unaware of the selection of courses offered by the university. [Test Card 4](test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was discarded for reasons found in [Learning Card 4](learning_cards.md).

- We believe students who keep a plan for the courses they do are forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it. [Test Card 5](test_cards.md)

This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Learning Card 5](learning_cards.md).

**Value Propositions**
- We believe that our market wants an easier way to identify the prerequisites for a given course

This hypothesis was accepted as many interviewees reported struggling to find information such as prerequisites, often having to open needlessly many browser tabs.

Evidence
1) "Oh, um for me, for my degree, it's pretty straightforward, because there's not too many prerequisites. But, like, the course profiles are a bit annoying to go through and like, have to look individually each course to find all the prerequisites for it. But, like, I know how to do it. It's like it's very well, like very commonly known. Yeah." - [Liam Bienkowski interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-20_2.md)
2) "First off, I'd like if it could have maybe an easier way to see when the classes run and what the prereqs are. And then another thing, when I was doing the dual degree, there was stuff where it's like, 'if you take this course and you're doing this major, then it counts towards the math degree." - [Patrick interview 6](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_09_01_6.md)

- We believe that our market wants a less convoluted process to select and enroll in courses

This hypothesis was discarded as it was found through interviews that the problem with selecting courses and not with the enrolling process, but the choosing of what courses to enrol in. Moreover, this was found to be more annoying than convoluted. This process is the one that is convoluted, whereas actually enrolling is straightforward.

Evidence
1) "Yes, the UI and experience throughout that process is terrible, yeah plenty of notetaking" - [Caleb Yates intervie 4](../../interviews/iteration_1/caleby/CALEB_2025_8_22_4.md)
2) "I think the website can be a bit frustrating when trying to find what course prerequisites are but other than that and on the study planner for mathematics computer science there is this just blank spot where it doesn't say anything in the course and that's a bit annoying but other than that, it's not too bad." [Rafael Chase interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/rafael_chase/rafael_2025_08_28_7.md)

- We believe that our market wants the ability to plan course completion order for their degree

This hypothesis is accepted based on many interviewees who reported that the ability to plan completion order would be quite helpful, especially by the way of prerequisites. 

Evidence
1) "I usually just write it down in a separate, like, word document plan that I've got set up." - [Liam Bienkowski interview 7](../../interviews/iteration_1/liam_bienkowski/liam_bienkowski_2025-08-27_7.md)
2) "I mostly have put it down onto a simple document, a plan for each of my semesters" - [Patrick interview 2](../../interviews/iteration_1/patrick/PATRICK_2025_08_25_2.md)
