# Business Model Canvas

**Customer Segments**
- We believe that our customers are undergraduate students who need to select courses every semester.
- We believe students invest more time than they would like in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites. [Test Card 1](test_cards.md)
- We believe that students make erroneous selections during course planning as a consequence of a lack of proper communication as prerequisites are not properly communicated. [Test Card 2](test_cards.md)
- We believe students enrol in courses having already completed the appropriate prerequisites. [Test Card 3](test_cards.md)
- We believe students are unaware of the selection of courses offered by the university. [Test Card 4](test_cards.md)
- We believe students who keep a plan for the courses they do are forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it. [Test Card 5](test_cards.md)

**Value Propositions**
- We believe that our market wants an easier way to identify the prerequisites for a given course
- We believe that our market wants a less convoluted process to select and enroll in courses
- We believe that our market wants the ability to plan course completion order for their degree
