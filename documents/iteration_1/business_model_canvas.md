# Business Model Canvas

**Customer Segments**
- We believe that our customers are undergraduate students who need to select courses every semester.
This hypothesis was accepted. The amount of feedback recieved in interviews demonstrate a demand from undergraduate students for a solution in this field to be developed. As shown in the evaluation of hypotheses in the [value proposition campus](value_proposition_canvas.md), many of the assumed pains and gains of this customer base were proven to be correct. 

- We believe students invest more time than they would like in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites. [Test Card 1](test_cards.md)
This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Learning Card 1](learning_cards.md).

- We believe that students make erroneous selections during course planning as a consequence of a lack of proper communication as prerequisites are not properly communicated. [Test Card 2](test_cards.md)
This hypothesis was discarded for reasons found in [Learning Card 2](learning_cards.md).

- We believe students enrol in courses having already completed the appropriate prerequisites. [Test Card 3](test_cards.md)
This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Learning Card 3](learning_cards.md).

- We believe students are unaware of the selection of courses offered by the university. [Test Card 4](test_cards.md)
This hypothesis was discarded for reasons found in [Learning Card 4](learning_cards.md).

- We believe students who keep a plan for the courses they do are forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it. [Test Card 5](test_cards.md)
This hypothesis was accepted for reasons found in [Learning Card 5](learning_cards.md).

**Value Propositions**
- We believe that our market wants an easier way to identify the prerequisites for a given course
This hypothesis was accepted as many interviewees reported struggling to find information such as prerequisites, often having to open needlessly many browser tabs. EVIDENCE

- We believe that our market wants a less convoluted process to select and enroll in courses
This hypothesis was discarded as it was found through interviews that the problem with selecting courses lied not with the enrolling process, but the choosing of what courses to enrol in. This process is the one that is convoluted, whereas actually enrolling is straightforward. EVIDENCE

- We believe that our market wants the ability to plan course completion order for their degree
This hypothesis is accepted based on many interviewees who reported that the ability to plan completion order would be quite helpful (quote) and xyz. EVIDENCE
