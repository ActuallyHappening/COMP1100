**Accepted Hypothesis:**

“we believed students would invest more time than strictly necessary in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites.” We accepted this hypothesis as we found a strong trend amongst most of the interviews that students found the process to be cumbersome, and longer than what they felt was necessary.

“We believed students enrolled in courses having already completed the appropriate prerequisites.” We accepted this hypothesis as we found students were more often than not aware of prerequisites, and actively completing them prior to completing branching courses. However, it is important to note students agreed this was always more difficult than they felt. I.e. they agreed a more seamless system would be highly beneficial.

“We believed students who kept a plan for the courses they do were forced to custom make it in a program not designed for it because of the current system.” This was found to be true. Students were unable to find the UQ planner at times, and resorted to other methods of planning, or following their friends / worrying about it when it came time to select courses.
