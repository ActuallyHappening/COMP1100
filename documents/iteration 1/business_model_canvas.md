# Business Model Canvas

**Customer Segments**
Our customers are undergraduate students who need to select courses every semester.
- We believe students invest more time than they would like in the course enrolment procedure as a consequence of the process spanning several sites, hence [hypothesis](hypothesis:waste-time-several-sites)
- We believe that students make erroneous selections during course planning as a consequence of a lack of proper communication as prerequisites are not properly communicated, hence [hypothesis](hypothesis:planning-errors-prereq-uncommunicated)

**Value Propositions**
- We believe that our market wants an easier way to identify the prerequisites for a given course
- We believe that our market wants a less convoluted process to select and enroll in courses
- We believe that our market wants the ability to plan course completion order for their degree, hence [hypothesis](hypothesis:make-plan-externally)
