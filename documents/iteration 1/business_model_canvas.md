## Business Model Canvas

**Customer Segments** (*Who are our customers and what are their problems?*)
- Our customers are comprised of undergraduate students who need to select courses every semester.

**Value Propositions** (*What are the solutions that we can make to solve our customers’ problems?*)
- An easier way to identify the prerequisites for a given course
- A less convoluted process to select and enroll in courses
- The ability to plan course completion order for their degree

~~**Channels** (*How do our customers in each segment want to be reached to learn about this and use it?*)~~

~~**Customer Relationships** (*How do our customers want to interact with us and how do we want them to ‘see’ us?*)~~

~~**Revenue Streams** (*Which value propositions are customer segments willing to pay, and how much?*)~~
